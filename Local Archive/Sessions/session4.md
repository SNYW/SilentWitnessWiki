# Session 4: Pop goes the David


## TL;DR

The crew learns about the big leagues — a hidden Night Market where the real Fixers play. Vulture wants in. Meanwhile, mystery girl **Bloam** shows her true colors (literally explodes a dude), and some gonk from a rival crew gets caught snooping. Now they've got a month to pull off something big enough to buy their way into the big time.

## Night Market Nightmare

**Vulture** pulls the crew aside, voice low. There's a Night Market coming in a month — not some jank street fair, but the real deal. The kind of event where the Fixers who can actually fix your problems show up. Getting through those doors means bringing something that'll make the big dogs notice you, plus paying the entry fee. **Vulture** covers the fee. The crew? They gotta bring the heat.

He's also tapped some Netrunners to dig up dirt on the other crews gunning for invites. Here's the shortlist:

- **Tesla Tyrants** — These gonks stream everything. Recording tech, stun batons, maximum spectacle.
- **Creeping Death** — Poisons. 'Nuff said.
- **The ModLits** — Drones and mines. Remote warfare for those who don't wanna get their hands dirty.
- **AI.DS** — Bioweapons. Diseases and the "cures" that somehow cost more than getting sick.

The crew can play it safe and cook up their own impressiveness, or they can go hunting and take what they need from the competition. Either way, they've got options.

While **Vulture's** laying out the plan, **Bloam** — that weird mystery girl they pulled from the vault — wanders out of the workshop like she's got somewhere to be. The crew tells **Roadblock** to tail her. He follows.

A few minutes later, a kid screams.

## The Bat and the Bird

**Roadblock** moves fast. Rounds the corner and finds **Sparrow** — that scrapper kid who's always running messages for the Vultures — getting worked over by his old man, **David**. **David's** hammered, swinging a baseball bat. Kid's got money hidden somewhere, and that's the only thing his pops care about.

**Roadblock** steps in. Grabs **David** by the throat, lifts him clean off the ground. But then **Bloam** arrives.

Gestures for **Roadblock** to put him down. She walks up slow. Places her hand on **David's** head.

Nothing happens for a second.

Then **David** doesn't fall. Doesn't scream. He *evaporates*. Red mist. Blood rain. Everything's painted red — the walls, the ground, **Sparrow's** unconscious body, **Roadblock's** face. And **Bloam**? She just walks away. Like it was nothing. Like it was just another Wednesday in Night City.

## Shell Shocked

**Roadblock** hauls **Sparrow** back to **Vultures Nest**. Kid's out cold, covered in his old man's remains. **Vulture** looks down at the kid and says it plain: "He's one of us now. Another orphan."

But **Roadblock's** not okay. He's losing his shit, keeps yelling about the "Glow Eyed Queen." Old wounds — he was *there* in 2020 when they went full terrorist. Saw what her Heralds could do. Hasn't recovered since.

The crew starts digging:

- **Glow Eyed Queen** — That's a Rampant AI. Took over a power plant back in 2020. Built herself a cult, started handing out chrome that turned her followers into walking weapons. Her main squeeze, **Shellbreaker**, led the parade attack. **Maxtac** finally took him down, but not before he blew a whole city block to kingdom come.
- Found the full video on NightTube. Some media gonk named **Phil M. Ovie** caught the whole thing.

So **Bloam's** either another Herald or something worse. **Roadblock** wants her deleted. **Magpie**? He's got other ideas — finally, a use for the weird girl.

## Eyes and Tears

Then they hear it. Wet footsteps outside. Someone's been listening to the whole damn conversation.

**Sal** moves fast. Grapple arm whips out, snags the listener before they can run. Guy's got an Agent, recording everything. **Magpie** smashes it in an instant, starts asking questions.

**Old Boy** doesn't do talking. He does *gestures* — gun barrel pressed under the guy's chin. Spills fast: he's from the **Tesla Tyrants**. That rival crew **Vulture** mentioned? They're on the invite list too, and now they know about **Bloam**.

The gonk tries to run. Hits **Sal** with a stun gun, breaks the grapple. **Roadblock** doesn't hesitate — hammer to the kneecap. **Sal** follows up with a sedative jab. Now they've got a prisoner.

**Loot:**
- Audio recorder
- Memory chip
- Cyberaudio suite
- Kevlar vest
- Stun gun + ammo

## The Plan

The crew decides fast: hit back at the **Tesla Tyrants**. They know about **Bloam** now, which means word's gonna spread. Hit first, ask questions later.

**Vulture** stands over **Sparrow** — still unconscious, but breathing. Kid belongs to the crew now. **Roadblock** speaks up: call him **Sparrowhawk** from here on out.

They've got a month to prep. A captured gonk from a rival crew. And a mystery girl who can turn a man into red mist.

Time to go big or go home.
