# Notable RED Era Locations

## Overview

During the Time of the Red (2020s-2040s), Night City was reorganized after the devastation of the Fourth Corporate War. Here are some of the most prominent locations:

---

## Old Japantown

**Type:** Combat Zone  
**Area:** The Island  
**Threat Rating:** High

### History

Originally part of the old Japantown and Little China districts. During the Fourth Corporate War, the area was badly damaged by firefights. After the Night City Holocaust, many residents fled to Watson Development. The area fell into chaos as gangs took power.

By the 2040s, Old Japantown was a sprawling dangerous combat zone with few residents. Despite the danger, some well-defended locations like the Crisis Medical Center and Highcourt Plaza Hotel remained as "islands of civilization."

### Notable Locations
- Crisis Medical Center
- Highcourt Plaza Hotel
- The Precipice (cargo container community)
- Honest Hiro's Used Cars
- Kaifū Corner
- Mrs. Suzuki's Bodega

### Notable Gangs
- Tyger Claws
- Maelstrom
- Bozos
- Red Chrome Legion
- Shroomers

## Watson Development

**Type:** Rebuilding Urban Zone  
**Area:** Northside  
**Threat Rating:** Low to Medium

### History

Originally the suburb of North Oak (pre-war). After the Fourth Corporate War, refugees flooded the area. The Night City Co-Prosperity Sphere (NCCS) — a conglomerate of Japanese corporations — helped displaced Asian communities relocate here from Japantown and Little China.

The NCCS invested heavily in infrastructure, renaming the area "Watson." By 2040, megabuildings started construction. By 2045, Watson was a booming district designed to become the new heart of Night City.

A high-security NCART monorail loop connects Watson to the Executive Zone and Little Europe. The NCCS built high-tech factories providing jobs.

### Notable Organizations
- Night City Co-Prosperity Sphere (NCCS)
- Petrochem
- SovOil
- Trauma Team

### Notable Gangs
- Tyger Claws (protected by NCCS as Kimen-Gumi)
- Kanzaki Family

## The Hot Zone

**Type:** Radioactive Ruins  
**Area:** The Island (Central)  
**Threat Rating:** Extreme

### History

The heart of Night City before and during the Fourth Corporate War. Devastated by nuclear weapons during the Arasaka/Militech conflict. The original City Center, Corporate Center, and Bank Block were reduced to radioactive ruins.

Still completely devastated during the RED era — too radioactive for habitation. Some daredevils and scavengers venture in, but it's extremely dangerous.

### Notable Ruins
- Arasaka Towers Ruins
- Old Bank Block
- Old City Center
- Tent City (squatters near the edges)
- Totentanz (club ruins)

---

## Little China (RED Era)

**Type:** Rebuilding Urban Zone  
**Area:** The Island  
**Threat Rating:** Medium

### History

Once part of the original Japantown and Little China areas. Heavily damaged during the war but in the process of rebuilding during the RED era.

Home to the Ling Po Public Library and various corporate offices. An emerging district with mixed residential and commercial areas.

### Notable Locations
- Ling Po Public Library
- Guǎngbō Tower
- Virtex's Virtuality Venue
- Hacienda Hotel

## Pacifica Playground

**Type:** Combat Zone  
**Area:** Southside  
**Threat Rating:** High

### History

Once a planned utopia, Pacifica was abandoned during the Fourth Corporate War when funding dried up. The infrastructure was never completed, leaving behind half-built megabuildings and skeleton structures.

By the RED era, it's a dangerous combat zone controlled by various gangs. The "Playground" name is ironic — it's anything but a safe place.

---

## Heywood

**Type:** Overpacked Suburb  
**Area:** Mainland  
**Threat Rating:** Medium to High

### History

A large residential district. Named after the famous 20th-century corporation Heywood Brothers. During the RED era, it's heavily populated with working-class residents.

Divided into several areas:
- North Heywood (wealthier)
- Heywood Docks (industrial port)
- Industrial Zone
- Santo Domingo (residential)

Home to the Vultures gang.

## The Precipice

**Type:** Cargo Container Community  
**Area:** Old Japantown (The Island)  
**Threat Rating:** High

### History

A community built from cargo containers in Old Japantown. Very close to the Hot Zone — radiation exposure is a constant concern for residents.

Home to scavengers who pick through the Combat Zone for salvage. The Crisis Medical Center nearby offers radiation check-ups.

Magpie operates his techie business here (Cargo Container CC05).

## The Midnight Market

**Type:** Exclusive Black Market Event  
**Area:** The Glen (Above The Atlantis Club)  
**Threat Rating:** Medium (for invited guests only)

### History

The Midnight Market is an exclusive quarterly black market event organized by Fixer Mister Kernaghan. It takes place above The Atlantis club in The Glen district.

Kernaghan initially worked IT for the Night City Port Authority. After the Fourth Corporate War and the Night City Holocaust, he collected shipping data from his position and used it to establish profitable trade routes for essential goods like food, water, and medicine.

Over time, he moved up the hierarchy and began selling rarer, more profitable goods. Now he organizes this elite market where the wealthy can purchase luxury items.

### The Experience

The Midnight Market sells goods of interest to high-end customers as well as an eclectic collection of super luxury items worth at least 10,000eb. Items available include:
- High-end vehicles
- Long-lost artworks
- Unique prototype technologies

The market is accessible only to those who receive a personal invitation. Kernaghan only works with other Fixers if they have something unique to offer at the auction.

### Notable Details
- Held quarterly above The Atlantis club
- Only accepts guests with personal invitations
- Kernaghan hand-selects vendors, caterers, and service providers
- Rental rates for vendor space are surprisingly reasonable
- Danger Gal provides security for the event
- Kernaghan's cat, Kosmos, is often seen at the market

### Mister Kernaghan

A former Night City Port Authority IT worker who became one of the most prominent Fixers during the Time of the Red. Known for his business acumen and connections to both Nomad packs and corporate interests.
