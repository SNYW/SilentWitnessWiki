# Time of the Red

**Tags:** Lore, The-Time-Of-The-Red, Night-City

## Overview

The **Time of the Red** (also known as the **Red Decades**) was a period from August 2023 to the late 2040s in Night City and the world at large. The name derives from the red skies that dominated the atmosphere as an aftereffect of the Fourth Corporate War.

## Historical Context

### The Fourth Corporate War

The Fourth Corporate War was a devastating conflict between megacorporations, primarily Arasaka and Militech. The war culminated in the Night City Holocaust—a nuclear detonation over Night City in 2023 that devastated the city center and created the Hot Zone.

### The Red Skies

Atmospheric particles from the nuclear blast in Night City, combined with debris from orbital weapon strikes, continent-wide firestorms, conventional explosives, and the wartime burning of cities and agricultural areas, cast an eerie red pall over skies worldwide. For nearly two years, the skies remained tinged a bloody red, eventually settling into brilliant red sunrises and sunsets throughout the next decade.

## Effects on Night City

### The Hot Zone

The nuclear blast created the **Hot Zone**—the radioactive ruins of old City Center, Corporate Center, and Bank Block. This area remains too radioactive for habitation during the RED era.

### City Devastation

- The majority of the population became homeless
- The sky stayed red for decades
- Old neighborhoods were rearranged, renamed, or scraped off into the bay if too radioactive
- The original heart of the metropolis remained devastated

### Recovery Efforts

During the Time of the Red, Night City underwent a slow rebuilding process. Each new area was governed by a City Manager, representing the interests of the area's major powers. The City Council assigned "threat ratings" to neighborhoods based on their danger level.

## Environment

### Blood Rains

Periodic "blood rains" occurred when rainstorms pulled the crimson particulate out of the skies and deposited it as a greasy crimson slime reminiscent of blood. This was a common phenomenon throughout the Red Decades.

### Night City's Four Areas

During the RED era, residents mentally divided Night City into four areas:
- **The Island** — Central area including Downtown, Little China, Little Europe
- **Northside** — Including Kabuki, Watson Development
- **Mainland** — Including Heywood, Charter Hill, Executive Zone
- **Southside** — Including Pacifica Playground, Rancho Coronado

### Environment Types

Night City's RED-era environments included:
- **Overpacked Suburbs** — Heavily populated residential areas
- **Rebuilding Urban Zones** — Areas under reconstruction
- **Combat Zones** — Dangerous areas with gang control

## Society During the Red

### Governance

Each district was governed by a **City Manager** who represented the interests of the area's major powers. The threat rating system was implemented to inform citizens about danger levels in different neighborhoods.

### Economy

The economy during the Time of the Red was characterized by:
- Barter systems and black markets
- Corporate control of essential resources
- Nomad involvement in transportation and trade
- Rise of fixers as middlemen for various jobs

### Culture

The Red era saw the emergence of new cultural phenomena:
- **Nomad culture** gained prominence as transportation became crucial
- **Edgerunners** became a common sight—mercenaries willing to take dangerous jobs
- **Gangs** filled power vacuums left by collapsed corporate and government authority

## Notable Events

### 2030s

- MaxTac (Maximum Force Tactical Division) was re-established under Commander Max Hammerman
- Various gangs consolidated power in different neighborhoods
- Reconstruction began in some areas

### 2040s

- The Night City Co-Prosperity Sphere (NCCS) invested heavily in Watson Development
- NCART monorail system began operations between key districts
- Recovery efforts accelerated but the Hot Zone remained devastated

### 2045

The height of the RED era as depicted in Cyberpunk RED. Key developments include:
- Dorado Family managing NCART operations
- Various neighborhoods with established threat ratings
- Active gang territories and corporate presence

## Legacy

The Time of the Red ended as the world's populations began reconstructing their shattered cities and the atmospheric effects faded. However, the name "Red" persisted among survivors, much like the "Roaring Twenties" or the "Great Depression" remained as historical designations.

The RED era shaped Night City into what it would become—a city of stark contrasts between gleaming corporate towers and devastated combat zones, between the wealthy elite and those struggling to survive.
