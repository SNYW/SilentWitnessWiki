## Description

The Pol-Bud Cement Factory is an abandoned industrial complex located in the eastern Badlands. Once a major producer of construction materials for the greater Night City metropolitan area, it was abandoned during the chaos of the Fourth Corporate War and has since become a haven for scavengers, scrap dealers, and those who prefer to stay far from civilization.

The factory consists of several large concrete structures, including:
- Main production halls with rusted machinery
- Office buildings in various states of decay
- Open-air storage yards filled with debris
- Rail spurs connecting to the old industrial transportation network

## RED Era (2045)

By 2045, Pol-Bud Cement Factory has become:
- A major source of scrap metal and reusable materials
- A临时 shelter for homeless and refugees
- A meeting point for black market deals
- An occasional defensive position for various factions

The factory's remote location and extensive structures make it ideal for those who don't want to be found. Multiple groups maintain semi-permanent camps within the complex.
