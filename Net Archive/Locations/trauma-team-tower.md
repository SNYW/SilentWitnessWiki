## Overview

Trauma Team Tower is a major corporate medical facility located in the Watson Development district of northern Night City. During the RED era, this tower serves as the primary base of operations for Trauma Team in Night City, housing their executive medical services and operational headquarters.

## History

After the Fourth Corporate War, the North American branch of Trauma Team survived by becoming regional providers only. Their original Night City offices did not survive the Night City Holocaust, and a new facility was erected in Watson Development during the Time of the Red.

By the 2040s, the massive building contained its own hospital where Trauma Team Executive clients were taken for medical treatment.
