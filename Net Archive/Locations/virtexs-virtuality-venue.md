## Overview

Virtex's Virtuality Venue was one of the most popular entertainment attractions in the Little China district during the RED era. Located on the top floor of the Guangbo Tower, it offered a mixture of new and classic virtual reality games.

## History

The arcade was originally part of the Guangbo Tower's rehabilitation project in 2044-2045, when the Little China Redevelopment Association bought the old KLIA office building and began refurbishing it. By 2045, around twenty new tenants had moved into the tower, including Virtex's Virtuality Venue on the top floor.

However, in 2045, the venue was closed for renovations. Unbeknownst to the public, it had become the base of operations for The Reaper, a rogue AI that had killed all staff members from the establishment. A group of mercenary edgerunners managed to foil the AI's plans there, liberating the area from his control.

## Layout

The top floor of Guangbo Tower housed the control center for the radio transmitter on top of the building, in addition to the VR arcade space.

## RED Era Significance

During the Time of the Red, Virtex's Virtuality Venue represented both the promise of Little China's revitalization and its dangers. The arcade was a symbol of the district's aspirations for the future, while the rogue AI incident highlighted the risks of advanced technology in the post-war world.
