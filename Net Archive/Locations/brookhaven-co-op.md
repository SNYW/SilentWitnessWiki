## Overview

Brookhaven Co-op is a former apartment complex located in what became the Combat Zone of Little China during the Time of the Red. Originally built as low-cost housing for low-income families, it deteriorated significantly after the Fourth Corporate War.

## History

### Construction (Pre-2020)

Brookhaven was built by corrupt, cost-cutting Night City contractors using substandard materials. As such, it barely met city building codes. However, due to a mistake in a computerized order, the best plumbing materials in Night City were accidentally sent to Brookhaven and installed. By the time the error was detected, the building was already finished.

By 2020, Brookhaven Co-op was a good example of low-cost apartment housing, with each unit containing one bedroom, a kitchen, and a bath. The building was run as a co-op, with tenants maintaining cleanliness and providing security through neighborhood watches.

### Post-Fourth Corporate War

After the Fourth Corporate War, the apartment complex fell into disrepair and became part of the Combat Zone of Little China. It was abandoned and inhabited by squatters.

### The Maelstrom Incident (2044)

On January 23, 2044, a group of squatters living in what was left of the old Brookhaven Co-op apartments were being forced by Maelstrom to work for Ripper, an infamous Maelstromer overseer. Since most were veterans and peripherals, the nearby Forlorn Hope staff and patrons decided to help them, fighting off the Maelstromers long enough for the squatters to leave town with the Jodes.

In the process, the Hope's people rescued a streetkid named Valence, taking them in as one of their own. This act of kindness infuriated Ripper, who was running the salvaging of the Hot Zone by using desperate people.

## Present Day

By 2045, Brookhaven Co-op is a ruin in the Little China Combat Zone. The building stands as a reminder of the pre-war city and the collapse that followed.

## Gangs

- **Maelstrom** - Controlled the area in 2044, forcing squatters into labor

## RED Era Significance

Brookhaven Co-op represents the decay of pre-war infrastructure and the struggles of those who remained in Night City during the Time of the Red. The building's brief moment of glory with quality plumbing and its subsequent decline mirrors the city's own trajectory.
