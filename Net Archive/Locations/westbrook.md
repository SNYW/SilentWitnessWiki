## Overview

Westbrook is an exclusive residential district in northern Night City, known for its luxury homes, executive zones, and high-end amenities. Originally developed as an upscale suburb in the late 20th century, Westbrook weathered the Fourth Corporate War better than many other Night City districts.

By the 2040s, Westbrook had become the premier destination for Night City's wealthy elite, corporate executives, and well-to-do families. The district features sprawling estates, luxury megabuildings, private security, and exclusive amenities that cater to those who can afford the premium lifestyle.

- Corporate executive offices
- Luxury retail and services
- Private security contracting
- High-end entertainment

## Notes

Westbrook represents the stark inequality of Night City during the RED era. While most of the city struggles with reconstruction and economic hardship, Westbrook thrives as a haven for the wealthy. The district's private security forces are well-equipped and well-trained, making it one of the safest areas in Night City—though at a significant cost to residents.

The presence of MaxTac rapid response teams provides additional security against any serious threats, though such incidents are rare in this heavily secured district.
