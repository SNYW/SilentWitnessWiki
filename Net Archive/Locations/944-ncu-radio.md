## Overview

94.4 NCU Radio was a combination club and radio station run by students and faculty members from Night City University around 2045, during the Time of the Red. The station usually played local bands and experimental music, serving as a cultural hub for the University District despite the surrounding chaos of the Combat Zone.

## Significance

The station represented the enduring spirit of higher education and counterculture in Night City during the post-War period. While South Night City's Combat Zone bordered the University District, NCU continued to operate as one of the few centers of learning in the city, and its radio station helped maintain a sense of normalcy and artistic expression.
