**District Code:** U  
**Type:** Corporate Development Zone  
**Threat Rating:** Low-Medium

## Overview

Watson Development is a thriving corporate zone in central Night City, situated along the western shore of Del Coronado Bay. Once a major commercial hub before the Fourth Corporate War, Watson experienced significant destruction during the Night City Holocaust but has since become one of the most successful reconstruction projects under the Night City Co-Prosperity Sphere (NCCS).

By the 2040s, Watson Development had become a symbol of recovery, with gleaming corporate towers rising from the rubble, modern megabuildings housing thousands of residents, and a bustling economy driven by Japanese corporations operating under the NCCS banner.

## Government

- **City Manager:** Appointed by NCCS
- **Security Provider:** Tyger Claws (Kimen-Gumi), NCPD
- **Gangs Present:** Tyger Claws, minimal other gang presence

## Notable Locations

### Megabuilding H8
A newly constructed residential megabuilding part of NCCS reconstruction efforts. Houses working-class edgerunners and corporate employees.

### Megabuilding H10
Another residential megabuilding in Watson, offering affordable housing in a relatively safe area.

### Thehorn
A popular edgerunner bar known for affordable drinks and a diverse clientele. Owned by Rosa "Mom" Chen.

### Trauma Team Tower
Corporate medical headquarters serving Watson and surrounding areas. A symbol of NCCS investment in the district.

### Nakagawa Kabuki Theater
The headquarters of the Tyger Claws gang, also serving as a cultural center for the Japanese community. Named after Shinobu Nakagawa.

## Economy

Watson's economy is driven by:
- NCCS corporate offices and investments
- Security contracting (Kimen-Gumi)
- Medical services (Trauma Team)
- Residential housing for workers
- Night markets and entertainment

## Notes

Watson represents the success story of the RED era reconstruction. Unlike other parts of Night City that still struggle with the aftermath of the Fourth Corporate War, Watson has bounced back strongly due to heavy NCCS investment. The presence of the Tyger Claws as a guardian gang provides security, though some critics argue they extract heavy protection fees from local businesses.

The district is popular with edgerunners seeking relatively housing with safe easy access to corporate work and the broader Night City economy.
