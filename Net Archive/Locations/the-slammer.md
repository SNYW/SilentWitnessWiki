## Overview

The Slammer is a notorious bar and fighting arena located on the southside docks of South Night City. Established in the 2040s after the Fourth Corporate War, this establishment is a popular ganger hangout known for its brutal cinder block arena where boosters from across Night City's Combat Zones settle their disputes with heavy firepower and bloody rippers.

## History

### Origins

The original Slammer was a popular club located in downtown Night City during the 2020s, famous for its own fighting arena. After the Fourth Corporate War, the old location was abandoned and a new Slammer was built on the waterfront of South Night City.

### The 2040s

By the 2040s, the new Slammer had established itself as a premier destination for gangers seeking violent entertainment. The venue is advertised as a no-holds-barred combat ring—though technically without murder. It became infamous among boosters and gangers throughout Night City's Combat Zones who came to settle disputes through organized violence.

The Slammer is also known for attracting sea nomads, who consider it the only nearby good place for drinking that isn't on a boat.

## Fighting Reputation

While the Redline in Watson Development is considered the best fighting arena in Night City for gladiatorial combat, The Slammer is the go-to venue for brawls and less sophisticated, yet brutal fights. The cinder block arena has hosted countless violent encounters between gangers from various factions.

## Notable Drinks

### CHOOH2

The signature "drink" served at The Slammer is made up of simple raw CHOOH2—a particularly potent and dangerous beverage favored by the ganger clientele.
