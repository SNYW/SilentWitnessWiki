## Overview

The Arasaka Towers Ruins are all that remains of the once-mighty Arasaka Corporation headquarters in Night City. The twin towers were the target of Johnny Silverhand's legendary attack in 2023, which culminated in a nuclear explosion that devastated the entire central business district.

## Description

What stands today is a twisted memorial to corporate ambition gone wrong. The nuclear blast sheared off the upper floors of both towers, leaving jagged stumps of steel and concrete. The lobby, once a monument to Arasaka's power, is now a tomb of shattered marble and rusted metal.

The towers remain highly radioactive, though levels have decreased since the immediate aftermath of the blast. Arasaka still maintains a keen interest in the site, though they have no official presence in the ruins.
