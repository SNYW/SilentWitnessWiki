# The Glen

**District Code:** GL  
**Type:** Government District / Rebuilding Urban Zone  
**Area:** Heywood (Central)  
**Threat Rating:** Low to Medium

## Overview

The Glen is a newly developed government district in central Night City, created during the Time of the Red as part of the city's reconstruction efforts. It was planned as the new seat of political power for Night City after the old City Center was destroyed in the Fourth Corporate War.

## History

### Creation (2030s-2040s)

During the rebuilding period of Night City, around a decade after the Fourth Corporate War, the Night City Council struck a deal with corporations to aid and fund the city's reconstruction. This project included The Glen, which was designed as the new seat of government power.

The Glen's boundaries incorporated areas from South Night City, the University District, and Little Asia. Over the following years, significant money was poured into the district, with massive construction efforts.

By the 2040s, the new City Hall and Hall of Justice were already open to the public. The Glen became a burgeoning district containing most of Night City's governmental buildings, as well as corporate and financial facilities.

### RED Era (2045)

In 2045, the South Night City Zoners discovered that a portion of their district funds had been redirected by Night Corp to upgrade the NCPD First Division headquarters in the Glen. This led to a massive protest that ended in a brawl against the NCPD, resulting in property damage and fires.

Despite being surrounded by Combat Zones on most sides, The Glen was considered one of the safest districts in Night City due to the constant presence of NCPD officers and private security companies.

## Notable Locations

- **Night City City Hall** — The new seat of municipal government, inaugurated in the 2040s
- **Hall of Justice** — Courts and legal offices, opened alongside City Hall
- **NCPD First Division Headquarters** — Upgraded in 2045, sparking controversy
- **Reconciliation Park** — Main green space in the district
- **1st Night City Bank Building**
- **Coyoacan Market** — Popular marketplace in the Glen

## Government

- **Security Provider:** NCPD First Division (heavily funded)

## Notes

The Glen represents the corporate-backed reconstruction of Night City's government infrastructure. While the northern and central areas are wealthy, clean, and relatively safe, just a few blocks away from City Hall things become noticeably poorer and more dangerous. The stark contrast between the government quarter and surrounding gang territories is a defining characteristic of the district.
