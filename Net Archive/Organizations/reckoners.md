## Overview

Reckoners are one of the most dangerous gangs operating in the Hot Zone during the Time of the Red. They are radical eco-terrorists who believe that the destruction of Night City was a necessary cleansing of corporate corruption.

## Description

The Reckoners are extreme radicals who view the nuclear destruction of 2023 as a divine cleansing. They believe that Night City and its corporate masters deserved destruction, and they see themselves as avengers of the land against corporate greed.

Their ideology makes them particularly dangerous — they view anyone who works with corporations or participates in the "corrupt" rebuilding effort as valid targets. They've been known to attack reconstruction crews, scavver operations, and anyone they perceive as supporting the "old order."
