## Overview

Orbital Air (OA) is a megacorporation specializing in cargo and passenger transport to Earth orbit. Based out of Nairobi, Kenya, OA holds a practical monopoly on orbital transportation, operating a large fleet of French-made Hermes spaceplanes and managing spaceports around the world.

The corporation works closely with the European Space Agency (ESA), Japan Aerospace Bureau (JAB), and various national space programs. During the Time of the Red, Orbital Air played a crucial role in rebuilding and expanding space infrastructure.

## RED Era Activities (2040s)

During the RED era, Orbital Air undertook major construction projects in Night City. The most notable was the NCX Spaceport (originally planned as the Orbital Air Massdriver) on Morro Rock in Del Coronado Bay. Construction began in 2045, though the project underwent significant changes from its original design.

The original plan called for a revolutionary mass driver launch system that would allow rocket-free spaceplane launches. However, Orbital Air management doubted the project's profitability without corporate backing and pivoted to building a civilian spaceport instead. The mass driver construction was cancelled, and the incomplete remains were eventually dismantled.

In 2047, the NCX Spaceport was finally inaugurated, becoming one of the largest spaceports in North America. The spaceport operates outside Night City jurisdiction, making it a neutral zone where only international laws apply.
