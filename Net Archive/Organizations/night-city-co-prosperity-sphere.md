## Overview

The Night City Co-Prosperity Sphere (NCCS) was a consortium of Japanese-based corporations formed in the aftermath of the Fourth Corporate War to protect and invest in the Japanese community of Night City. This conglomerate played a pivotal role in the reconstruction of northern Night City during the Time of the Red, sponsoring the Tyger Claws gang as their protective force and funding the development of the Watson Development district.

## History

### Formation (Early 2020s)

Following the devastating Fourth Corporate War and the subsequent Night City Holocaust of 2023, many Japanese communities in Night City were displaced from their original homes in Japantown and Little China. A consortium of Japanese corporations came together to form the Night City Co-Prosperity Sphere, dedicated to rebuilding and protecting these communities.

The NCCS was led by the famous actor Shinobu Nakagawa, who became the public face of the organization. Under his leadership, the consortium invested heavily in infrastructure, housing, and community development in northern Night City.

### Watson Development Project

The NCCS's primary project was the development of the Watson Urban Reconstruction Zone, later known as Watson Development. This district was designed to house displaced Japanese and Chinese communities from the ruined old districts.

Key achievements included:
- Funding the construction of megabuildings for displaced residents
- Building high-tech factories providing reliable employment
- Sponsoring the reconstruction of the NCART monorail system
- Establishing the new Kabuki district for Japanese residents

### The Tyger Claws Connection

One of the NCCS's most significant decisions was to sponsor and reform the Tyger Claws gang into a guardian organization. The gang, originally an Arasaka-backed motorcycle club, was converted into a protective force for the Japanese community.

To provide legal cover, the NCCS created the Kimen-Gumi as a legitimate security company that could operate openly with NCPD contracts while the broader Tyger Claws organization handled matters "off the books."

## Organization Structure

### Leadership
- **Shinobu Nakagawa** - Founder and public leader
- Corporate board representatives from member companies

### Member Companies
The NCCS comprised various Japanese corporations, including:
- Arasaka (original sponsor, though relations were complicated post-war)
- Other Japanese manufacturing and tech firms

### Affiliated Organizations
- **Tyger Claws** - Guardian gang
- **Kimen-Gumi** - Legal security arm

## Territory

During the RED era, the NCCS's influence extended across:
- **Watson Development** - Primary project and base of operations
- **Kabuki** - New Japanese residential district
- **Old Japantown** - Historical territory undergoing reconstruction
- Portions of **Little China** (southern Watson)

## Sources of Income

- Corporate investments from member companies
- Factory and manufacturing operations
- Security contract oversight (through Kimen-Gumi)
- Real estate development
- Technology exports

## Legacy

The Night City Co-Prosperity Sphere represents a unique corporate phenomenon in Night City's history—a consortium that genuinely worked to rebuild communities rather than simply exploit them. Their sponsorship of the Tyger Claws created one of the most enduring guardian gangs in the city's history.

By the 2070s, the NCCS had largely dissolved as a formal entity, though its legacy lives on in the Tyger Claws' continued presence and the developed districts of northern Night City.

## Notes

The NCCS is distinct from Arasaka's direct corporate operations—it was a coalition of multiple Japanese companies rather than a single megacorp. This structure allowed them to operate more flexibly during the chaotic post-war period.
