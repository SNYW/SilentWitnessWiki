## Overview

The Faded is a group of older edgerunners who have carved out a niche in the Old Combat Zone. Unlike the aggressive expansionist tactics of groups like Edgerunners Inc, The Faded takes a more defensive posture—dedicated to keeping Night City proper from interfering with their territory in the ruins of the southeastern expansion.

## History

The Faded emerged during the chaotic years following the Fourth Corporate War and the Night City Holocaust. Unlike many gangs formed during the Time of the Red that focus on territorial expansion or criminal enterprise, The Faded consists of veteran edgerunners who have "faded" from the mainstream mercenary scene.

Many members are former solos, netrunners, and fixers who have grown weary of the corporate rat race but aren't ready to hang up their weapons entirely. They settled in the Old Combat Zone because it's one of the few places in Night City where the corps and NCPD have minimal presence.

## Philosophy

The Faded's core philosophy is live and let live. They:
- Don't seek confrontation with Night City proper
- Focus on protecting their territory in the Old Combat Zone
- Are skeptical of outside interference, whether corporate or governmental
- Maintain a code of honor among veterans

## Organization

The group operates as a loose collective rather than a traditional hierarchy. Leadership is earned through respect and experience rather than force. Members typically:
- Have years of experience as edgerunners
- Prefer to work alone or in small teams
- Share information and resources when needed
- Defend the Old Combat Zone as their home territory

## Territory

The Faded operates primarily in the Old Combat Zone, specifically:
- The abandoned industrial sectors
- Various ruins in the southeastern expansion area
- Hidden safehouses throughout the zone

They maintain a working relationship with nearby groups like Generation Red and The Shroomers, sharing intelligence about threats from outside the zone.

## Relations

- **Edgerunners Inc:** Cautious allies. Both want to rebuild the Old Combat Zone, but The Faded is skeptical of Edgerunners Inc's ambitions to reconnect to Night City proper.
- **Generation Red:** Friendly. Both groups share a common goal of protecting the zone from outside interference.
- **The Shroomers:** Neutral. The Faded respects the Shroomers' independence but doesn't actively cooperate with them.
- **Iron Sights:** Wary. The Faded keeps distance from Iron Sights due to their aggressive tactics.
- **Night City:** Oppositional. The Faded views Night City proper as a threat to their independence.

## Notable Members

While The Faded keeps a low profile, they are known to include experienced veterans from various fields:
- Veteran Solos who have seen too many friends die for corporate causes
- Former Netrunners who prefer the relative safety of the zone's fragment NET
- Retired Fixers who manage the group's dealings with the outside world

## In Popular Culture

The Faded are often romanticized in screamsheets as "the ghosts of the Old Combat Zone"—veteran edgerunners who chose to fade away rather than continue running the corporate hamster wheel. Some view them as cowards who gave up; others see them as the wisest operators in Night City.
