## Overview

The Consortium is a criminal organization operating in the Port of Night City area during the Time of the Red. They are one of the primary groups competing for control of the valuable waterfront infrastructure.

## Description

The Consortium has established themselves as a significant force in the Port of Night City, one of the few areas where cargo can still enter and leave the city by sea. They engage in smuggling, cargo theft, and various other illegal waterfront activities.

By 2045, the Port is primarily controlled by nomads from the Thelas Nation, but the Consortium maintains a presence alongside other groups like DeadWoods. The competition for control of the docks is fierce, as whoever controls the port controls a vital lifeline for Night City's black market.
