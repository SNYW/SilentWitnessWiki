## Overview

The Philharmonic Vampyres are an artsy prankster gang operating in Night City. To some they are artists, to others social commentators, and to their victims common hoodlums. Their pranks are often annoying or expensive to clean up if you're the target, but generally not actually dangerous to people.

## History

### Pre-War Era (2020)

Prior to the Fourth Corporate War, the Philharmonic Vampyres were based in a maze of tunnels and storage rooms below the Bodukkan Center. This often put them at odds with Arasaka security. They were generally found around the city center but did not defend any turf.

The gang has a weird intolerance for street mimes and goes out of their way to harass them. This puts them at odds with the Julliard, who will go out of their way to attack them in return.

Though otherwise harmless, it is rumored that they share membership with a more violent gang, the Werewolves of London. They are often found in the area around Werewolf crime scenes.

### Time of the Red

After the Fourth Corporate War, the gang was approached by Lord Ruthven, who started to fund them. They moved to the University District and claimed it as their turf. Around this time, they would focus on arts, organizing vampire-themed shows in the Night City Symphony Hall.

As time went on, however, Lord Ruthven had turned into a murderous cyberpsycho and threatened to kill the entire gang when they confronted him. This would prompt the gang to hiring a group of edgerunners to murder Lord Ruthven with discretion once he left them and started abducting women around the University District.
