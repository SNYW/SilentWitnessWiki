**Type:** Community Redevelopment Organization  
**District:** Little China (Combat Zone)  
**Era:** Time of the Red (2040s)

## Overview

The Little China Redevelopment Association (LCRA) is a community organization established during the rebuilding stages of Night City following the Fourth Corporate War. On the surface, it was a conglomerate formed by wealthy members of the Chinese community, with the main purpose of revitalizing the Combat Zone of Little China.

Despite their efforts, by 2045 the LCRA had only managed to secure and begin rebuilding a few blocks in the dangerous combat zone. Their work represents both the hope and the limitations of community-driven reconstruction during the Time of the Red.

## History

### Formation

The LCRA was established during the initial rebuilding stages of Night City after the devastating Fourth Corporate War and the Night City Holocaust. The organization's founders were wealthy members of the Chinese community who sought to restore their cultural district to its former glory.

### Rebuilding Efforts

The LCRA purchased and began rehabilitating several properties in Little China, most notably the Guăngbō Tower (formerly the KLIA office building). By 2044-2045, the organization had managed to:

- Secure several blocks within the combat zone
- Establish a medical clinic
- Create a public library (Ling Po Public Library)
- Set up various small businesses
- Provide some stability in otherwise dangerous territory

### Connection to David Ling Po

The involvement of David Ling Po, rumored leader of the Weng Fang Tong crime organization, as city manager appointed by the LCRA, has led to speculation about the organization's true nature. Some suspect the LCRA may have connections to darker elements in Little China, though this remains unconfirmed.

## Activities

### Security Operations

To keep their secured areas safe, the LCRA paid a local boostergang known as the Gold Dragons to provide security in exchange for money. This arrangement allowed the LCRA to maintain control over their redevelopment zones while providing the Gold Dragons with legitimate employment.

### Property Development

The LCRA's main activities include:
- Purchasing abandoned properties in Little China
- Renovating and refurbishing buildings
- Attracting businesses and tenants
- Providing community services

### Community Services

Within areas under LCRA control, residents enjoy a more relaxed environment, as many of the dangers of the Combat Zone have been quelled. The LCRA provides:

- Security through the Gold Dragons arrangement
- Access to the Ling Po Public Library
- Medical services through their clinic
- Business opportunities in renovated spaces

## Notable Projects

### Guăngbō Tower

The LCRA's flagship project was the rehabilitation of Guăngbō Tower, a thirty-story skyscraper that had been abandoned since the Fourth Corporate War. By 2045, around twenty new tenants had moved in, including:

- A medical clinic
- Ling Po Public Library
- An arcade
- Various small businesses

The tower became a symbol of Little China's aspirations for the future.

### Ling Po Public Library

Financed by city manager David Ling Po, the library offers many services to the community but is only accessible to district residents.

## Territory

The LCRA controls a small but growing pocket of stability within the otherwise dangerous Little China Combat Zone. Their territory represents one of the few places in the combat zone where life approaches normalcy.

## Relationships

### With Gangs

- **Gold Dragons** - Paid security force protecting LCRA territory
- **Weng Fang Tong** - Possible connection through David Ling Po
- **Tyger Claws** - Competing gang presence in the area
- **Red Chrome Legion** - Rival faction in the combat zone

### With Community

The LCRA is viewed as a hope for recovery by many residents of Little China, though others are skeptical of their connections to criminal elements.

## Threat Assessment

**Threat Level:** Low (within LCRA-controlled areas)

While Little China as a whole is considered a Very High threat area, the specific blocks controlled by the LCRA are relatively safer due to the Gold Dragons security presence.

## Notes

The LCRA represents both the hope and the complexity of rebuilding efforts during the Time of the Red. Their work shows that community-driven reconstruction was possible, but often required dealing with morally ambiguous characters and organizations to achieve stability in dangerous areas.
