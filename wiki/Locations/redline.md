## Overview

The Redline is an infamous bar and fighting arena located in the Watson Development district of northern Night City. Established during the Time of the Red, the venue gained legendary status in the 2040s for hosting the most thrilling augmented and unaugmented fighting events in all of Night City.

Unlike typical bars where brawls break out spontaneously, The Redline is specifically designed for organized gladiatorial combat. The entire establishment is built around a central fighting pit, with customers watching from the caged upper level or private viewing rooms with armored windows.

## History

### Origins (Early 2040s)

The Redline was founded as a specialized combat venue during the early 2040s. Unlike typical bars where patrons engaged in spontaneous fisticuffs, The Redline offered structured gladiatorial combat as its main attraction. Over time, it developed a reputation for hosting the best live fighting events in Night City.

The venue installed a cage over the fighting arena after a cybered-up combatant threw her opponent clean out of the pit and onto some customers. Officially, all battles are until knockout, with the establishment maintaining a Trauma Team membership so badly injured fighters can receive treatment.

### 2045 - The Forlorn Hope Connection

In 2045, after the owners of the Forlorn Hope put a price on the Maelstrom ganger known as Ripper's head, hired mercenaries visited The Redline to track down their target. Ripper was known to frequent the bar, and the mercenaries had to impress him to gain his trust and lead him into a trap.

## Layout

The bar is built around a central fighting pit where gladiators compete to entertain the crowds. Key features include:

- **Main Arena:** A fighting pit at the center of the establishment
- **Upper Bar Area:** Customers watch fights from above the pit or surrounding screens
- **Private Rooms:** For patrons who want ringside views through armored windows
- **No Firearms Policy:** Weapons are not permitted inside the venue
- **Melee-Only Combat:** Only unarmored melee combatants can participate, though implanted armor is allowed

## The Wild Things

The Wild Things are The Redline's in-house gladiatorial gang, led by the bar's owner, Jenny Nails. They battle anyone willing to fight them during open fight days. The gang serves as both entertainment and security for the venue.
