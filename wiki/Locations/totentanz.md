## Overview

Totentanz (German for "Dance of Death") is a legendary nightclub located in the ruins of the Hot Zone, near the old Corporate Center. Originally one of Night City's most exclusive clubs before the Fourth Corporate War, it was destroyed during the conflict but has been partially restored by unknown parties.

## History

### Pre-War Era

Before the devastation of the Fourth Corporate War, Totentanz was one of Night City's most exclusive nightclubs. Located in the heart of the Corporate Center, it attracted the city's elite—corporate executives, wealthy edgerunners, and celebrities. The club was famous for its elaborate themed parties, state-of-the-art sound systems, and strict door policy.

### The War and Destruction

During the Arasaka/Militech conflict that led to the Night City Holocaust, the Corporate Center was devastated by nuclear weapons. Totentanz was destroyed in the blasts, reduced to burning ruins.

### RED Era (2040s)

In the decades following the war, rumors began circulating about Totentanz being restored deep within the Hot Zone's radioactive ruins. Some claim a mysterious group has rebuilt all or part of the club, operating it as an exclusive venue for those brave or foolish enough to venture into the most dangerous area of Night City.

## Access

Getting to Totentanz is extremely dangerous:
- The Hot Zone remains highly radioactive
- Multiple routes exist, all passing through contaminated areas
- Some routes require passing through Maelstrom territory
- Only the most experienced guides know the way

## Reputation

- An exclusive, invitation-only atmosphere

## Notes

- The club's exact location within the Hot Zone is a closely guarded secret
- Some believe the partygoers are either suicidal, heavily cybered, or both
