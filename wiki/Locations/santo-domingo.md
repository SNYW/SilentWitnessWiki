## Locations

### (V1) Aldecaldo Camp
A large multi-cultural encampment sitting at the base of the Petrochem dam. While all nomads are welcome, the camp is primarily dominated by the Aldecaldos.

### (V2) City Police Precinct #2
Large but overworked, the cops here rely heavily on drones to patrol their beats.

### (V3) East Cargo Village
A dusty cargo container community located near the edge of the city.

### (V4) Heywood Suites
An apartment complex situated beneath one of the most heavily trafficked overpasses in Night City. Many residents have level-dampening cyberware installed.

### (V5) María's
A family-owned beer tent located just inside the city limits.

### (V6) MetalStorm
A seemingly indestructible bar located under the Pacifica Bridge. Popular with FBCs.

### (V7) Woodchipper's Garage
The home base of Woodchipper, the most influential nomad Fixer in Night City. She throws her famous Night Markets/ block parties in the cul-de-sac to the southwest.

## Notes

Santo Domingo is heavily influenced by the Aldecaldo nomads. Theresa Valentino's election with El Norte cartel backing represents shifting power dynamics in the district.
