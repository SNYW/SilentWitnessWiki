# Bloam

**Tags:** NPC, Status-Alive, Vultures, Mystery, Glow-Eyed-Queen, Session-2, Session-3, Session-4

## Basic Info

- **Name:** Bloam (original designation from cryo-pod: 6L04M)
- **Role:** Mystery Girl / Potential Herald of the Glow Eyed Queen
- **Status:** Active — Allied with the Vultures
- **Affiliation:** The Vultures (tentative)

## Appearance

**Bloam** is a skinny, small, childlike girl standing about 4ft 10. She has dark grey skin and stark short white hair. She appears youthful — somewhere between 12 and 16 in human years, though her true age is unknown.

She doesn't speak much. Her eyes occasionally glow faintly — a sign some believe marks her as connected to the **Glow Eyed Queen**.

## History

### Discovery

The crew first encountered **Bloam** in **Session 2: The Vault** — a bombed-out cryo facility. She was found in a highly technological cryo-pod, one of dozens of sleepers in the underground complex. When removed from the pod, she didn't stir.

The crew extracted her and brought her back to **Vultures Nest**.

### Awakening

In **Session 3**, **Bloam** awakened from cryosleep. She typed rapidly on her cryosleep casket, displaying the entire history of the area since around 2018 at superhuman speed. Her abilities were already showing signs of being far beyond normal human capacity.

### True Power Revealed

In **Session 4**, **Bloam's** terrifying power was revealed when **Sparrow's** abusive father **David** was attacking the boy. When **Roadblock** intervened, **Bloam** approached and placed her hand on **David's** head. He instantly evaporated into red mist — blood and gore covering everything nearby.

**Bloam** then simply walked away, showing no emotion.

## Capabilities

- **Disintegration Touch:** Bloam can instantly vaporize a person by touching their head. The effect is instantaneous — no warning, no struggle. The target simply ceases to exist in a spray of blood and mist.
- **Unknown Tech/Abilities:** Her display of superhuman typing speed and knowledge absorption suggests advanced tech or AI integration. Her connection to the **Glow Eyed Queen** remains unconfirmed but suspected.
