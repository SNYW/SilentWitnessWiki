# Session 1: The Transformer Job

**Tags:** Session-Log, Session-1, Vultures-Arc, Bozos-Conflict, Combat-Encounter

## Background

The Vultures informed the gang that they had won a piece of paper in a gambling game. Bluejay (Bekah) was convinced it was a treasure map of some kind and directed the players to investigate the transformer it depicted in the wasteland.

Magpie analyzed the map and determined that if they could confirm a nearby transformer was still drawing power, it would lead them to a morgue — which meant free cyberware for him.

## Events

1. **The Briefing** — Vultures inform the party about the paper. Bluejay believes it's a treasure map and pushes to investigate the transformer it shows.

2. **Travel to Transformer** — The party travels to investigate the transformer in the wasteland.

3. **Confrontation** — The team is confronted by the **Bozos**, a gang that has been harassing Magpie for ages. They want to hire Magpie and are insulted that he's working with the party instead of them.

4. **Mr Tubbs** — The Bozo leader. He recognizes other members of the party and is personally offended that Magpie isn't working with him.

5. **Conflict** — After attempting to convince the Bozos to leave (they tried to follow anyway), combat ensues.

6. **Outcome** — The team kills Mr Tubbs, loots his cyber arm and other bits, but a few Bozos escape back into the Precipice.
