# Session 4: The Glow Queen

**Tags:** Session-Log, The-Time-of-the-Red, Session-4, Night-Market-Arc, Bloam-Reveal, Tesla-Tyrants-Encounter

## TL;DR

The crew learns about the big leagues — a hidden Night Market where the real Fixers play. Vulture wants in. Meanwhile, mystery girl Bloam shows her true colors (literally explodes a dude), and some gigachad from a rival crew gets caught snooping. Now they've got a month to pull off something big enough to buy their way into the big time.

## The Meet

Vulture lays it out on the down-low: there's a Night Market happening in a month. Not some street fair — the *real* deal. The kind of place where the Fixers who actually *fix* things show up. Getting in means bringing something impressive enough to turn heads, plus the entry fee. Vulture covers the fee — the crew needs to bring the heat.

He's also gotten intel on the other crews angling for invites. Netrunners did some digging. Here's the lineup:

- **Tesla Tyrants** — Stream everything. Recording tech, stun batons, maximum spectacle.
- **Creeping Death** — Poisons. 'Nuff said.
- **The ModLits** — Drones and mines. Remote warfare merchants.
- **AI.DS** — Bioweapons. Diseases and the "cures" that cost more than the sickness.

The crew can ignore the competition, cook up something themselves, or knock over one of these teams and take their ticket. Options are open.

## Ghosting Out

Bloam — the mystery girl from the vault — wanders out of the workshop like she's got somewhere to be. Roadblock's been assigned to keep eyes on her, so he trails along.

A few minutes later, a kid screams.

Roadblock books it ahead. Finds Sparrow getting worked over by his old man — David, drunk as hell, swinging a bat. Kid's hiding money, turns out. Street kid logic: you hide what you got or it gets taken.

Roadblock steps in. Grabs David by the throat. And then Bloam shows up.

She puts her hand on David's head.

He doesn't fall. Doesn't scream.

He *evaporates*. Red mist. Blood rain. Kid goes down, Roadblock's coated, and Bloam just... walks off. No big deal. Just another Tuesday.

## The Fallout

Roadblock hauls Sparrow back to the Nest. Kid's out cold, covered in his old man's remains. Vulture's standing over him: "He's one of us now. Another orphan."

Roadblock's losing it. Keeps shouting about the "Glow Eyed Queen." Old trauma — he was *there* when she went full terrorist in 2020. Saw what she did. What her "Heralds" can do.

The crew digs in:

- **Glow Eyed Queen:** Rampant AI, took over a power plant in 2020. Built a cult. Gave her followers chrome that made them walking weapons. Her right hand — "Shellbreaker" — led a parade attack. Maxtac finally dropped him, but he took a city block with him.
- Full video's out there on NightTube. Phil M. Ovie documented the whole thing.

Bloam's either another Herald or something worse. Roadblock wants her gone. Magpie wants her *monetized*. At least she's useful.

## The Noodle

Wet footsteps outside. Someone's listening.

Sal — new meat, medtech — snags them with a grapple arm. Quick work. Guy was recording the whole conversation on an Agent. Magpie cracks it, starts the interrogation.

Old Boy doesn't talk. He *gestures* — gun barrel to the chin. Guy's from the Tesla Tyrants. They're on the Night Market invite list too, and now they know about Bloam.

Gigachad tries to dust — hits Sal with a stun gun, breaks the grapple. Roadblock drops him with a hammer to the kneecap. Sleepy-time juice from Sal, and now they've got a prisoner.

**Loot:**
- Audio recorder
- Memory chip
- Cyberaudio suite
- Kevlar vest
- Stun gun + ammo

## The Plan

Retaliation's on the table. The Tyrants know about Bloam now — word's gonna spread. Better to hit first.

Vulture's standing over Sparrow, unconscious but breathing. Kid's officially Vulture property now. Roadblock's got a name for him: Sparrowhawk.

They've got a month. A captured gonk from a rival crew. And a mystery girl who can turn people into red mist.

Time to go big or go home.
