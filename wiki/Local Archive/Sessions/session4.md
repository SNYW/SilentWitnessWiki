## Events

### Night Market Introduction
- Vulture informs the party about an upcoming hidden Night Market in one month
- To gain access, they must produce something impressive enough to catch the attention of big-time Fixers
- Vulture will cover the entry fee, but the party must provide the impressive tech
- Vulture has enlisted Netrunners to scope out the competition

### Bloam Leaves
- Bloam (the mystery girl) walks out of the workshop
- Roadblock follows her

### The Incident
- Roadblock hears a child screaming and rushes ahead
- Sparrow is being beaten by his drunk father David with a baseball bat
- Roadblock intervenes, confronting the father
- David is drunk and aggressive — claims Sparrow hid money from them
- Roadblock picks David up by the neck

- The area is coated in blood, Sparrow is knocked unconscious
- Bloam walks off indifferently

### Aftermath
- Roadblock brings Sparrow back to Vultures Nest
- Ronnie (Roadblock) has a breakdown, shouting about the "Glow Eyed Queen"

### Research
- The party researches the Glow Eyed Queen on their Agents:
  - **History:** Rampant AI that took over a power plant in 2020
  - Started a cult large enough to stage a terrorist attack on Night City
  - Gave her followers powerful augments, especially her Warlock "Shellbreaker"
  - Shellbreaker led the terrorist attack parade
  - Only stopped when MaxTac intervened
  - Shellbreaker detonated a high-yield explosive, taking out a city block
- Sal finds full video of the event on NightTube by media Phil M. Ovie
- Roadblock suspects Bloam is a herald of the Glow Eyed Queen — he was present at the attack and witnessed her atrocities

### Reactions
- **Roadblock:** Wants Bloam destroyed, keeps yelling "I fucking hate clankers"
- **Magpie:** Overjoyed — sees Bloam as their ticket to the Night Market

### The Spy

- Sal (new Medtech PC) catches him with a grapple arm
- He's recording with an agent — Magpie breaks it
- Interrogation begins — Old Boy threatens him with a gun to the chin
- He reveals he's from a rival Night Market team: the **Tesla Tyrants**
- Known for high-tech recording/live streaming equipment and stunning weaponry

### Capture
- He hits Sal with a stun gun to break the grapple
- Roadblock breaks his kneecap with a hammer
- Sal injects him with a sleeping agent — he's captured

### Loot
- Audio recorder
- Memory chip
- Cyberaudio suite
- Kevlar vest
- Stun gun + ammo

### Resolution
