## Background

Coming from a nomadic tribe of gunslingers called the Red Hawks, Gallahan's father was the leader of this large clan — a man who gave to those less fortunate and used his skills for good. Until he was unfairly gunned down by the one he once called his brother.

Finding purpose with the NCPD as their best detective and meeting a man named Ronnie who became an uncle to him, Gallahan plans on hunting down those who were present that fateful day and reclaim his clan in the name of his father.

He is currently working for the Vultures, assisting Magpie just like Roadblock.
