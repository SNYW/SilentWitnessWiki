## Overview

The Bozos are a notorious gang of killer clowns who terrorize Night City during the Time of the Red. What began as a simple prankster gang has evolved into one of the city's most feared organizations, known for their horrific "pranks" and body-sculpted clown appearances.

## History

### Origins (2017-2020)

The Bozos first appeared in the West Hill district around 2017. Originally dismissed as a harmless prankster gang, their members stylized themselves after circus clowns. However, they took their aesthetic to extremes, biosculpting their bodies to look exactly like clowns — complete with colorful hair, red bulbous noses, white skin grafts forming permanent frowns, and long flat feet.

Their early activities were relatively benign: splashing paint on street artists, dropping water balloons on parked cars, and playing practical jokes on corporate women. However, in 2019, everything changed when they acquired a new leader known as the Great Bozo, who introduced dangerous devices and extreme cyberware experiments.

### Time of the Red (2040s)

By the 2040s, the Bozos had become a living nightmare legend across Night City. Their "pranks" evolved into horrific acts of violence — locking victims in spaces filled with rats, stopping elevators and filling them with water, and using SecSystems Detention Collars to electroshock victims repeatedly. The gang grew their numbers by targeting victims, harassing them until they broke down, then torturing them until they agreed to join.

In 2045, during the annual Hilaria event, Big Top — one of the gang's powerful leaders — led an attack on the Forlorn Hope bar, killing eleven people. This attack sparked a civil war within the gang, splitting them into at least thirteen different "circuses" competing against each other.
