## Background

The Red Hawks are a nomadic tribe of gunslingers who roam the wastes, living by a code of honor: protect the innocent, give to those less fortunate, and never betray your brothers.

Led by Gallahan's father, the clan was once large and prosperous. When he was betrayed and gunned down by his own brother, the clan fractured. Many members scattered to neighboring clans or went into hiding.
