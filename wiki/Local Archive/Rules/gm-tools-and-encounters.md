# GM Tools, Mooks, and Encounters


---

## Adversary Tiers (p. 412)

Cyberpunk RED uses a tiered adversary system for building encounters. NPCs in this section have **no Roles, Role Abilities, or LUCK** unless noted otherwise.

| Tier | Name | Power Level | Ratio to Edgerunners |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mook** | Low-level adversary | Lesser Skill than Edgerunners | 1 Mook = 1 Edgerunner |
| **Lieutenant** | Mid-level adversary | Equal or slightly greater Skill | 1 Lieutenant = 2 Edgerunners |
| **Mini Boss** | High-level adversary | Substantially more powerful | 1 Mini Boss = 3 Edgerunners |
| **Cyberpsycho** | Boss battle | Extremely dangerous | Full boss encounter |

### Building Encounters (p. 400)

Scale encounters using a battle progression across the adventure:

- **Battle 1 — Mooks:** Equal number of Mooks to Edgerunners. If the Crew is combat-heavy, Mooks can outnumber 2-to-1.
- **Battle 2 — Lieutenants:** 1 Lieutenant per 2 Edgerunners. Fill remaining slots with Mooks to match Crew size (each Lieutenant counts as 2).
- **Battle 3 — Mini Bosses:** 1 Mini Boss per 3 Edgerunners, supplemented by Lieutenants and Mooks to match total.

Characters with powerful weapons or cyberware may count as 2-3 Edgerunners for encounter building purposes. Conversely, equipping Mooks with better gear makes them punch above their tier. (p. 400)
