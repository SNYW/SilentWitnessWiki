## Rate of Fire (ROF) and Split Movement (p. 169)

- Weapons with **2 ROF** can fire twice per Attack Action. These are called **2 Rate of Fire Attacks (2 ROF)**.
- All attacks from **2 ROF** sources can be "split" across a Move Action: move, shoot, move, shoot, move.
- You can split your two attacks across **two different 2 ROF weapons**, one attack from each.
- **1 ROF** weapons take your whole Attack Action, but you can still split movement around them.
- No matter how many weapons you hold, you can **never make more than two Attack Checks** as part of an Action. (p. 169)
- You **cannot** attack with two **1 ROF** weapons in the same Action, even if dual-wielding. (p. 169)

---

## Aimed Shots (Ranged) (p. 170)

At a maximum of **1 ROF**, you can aim a single Ranged Attack by taking your entire Action and a **-8 to your Check**.

| Aiming For... | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Head** | Multiply the damage that gets through your target's **head armor** by **2** |
| **Held Item** | If a single point of damage gets through body armor, target **drops one held item** of your choice |
| **Leg** | If a single point of damage gets through body armor, target also suffers the **Broken Leg** Critical Injury (if they have unbroken legs) |

---

## Autofire (p. 173-174)

- Costs an **Action** and **10 bullets**. If you don't have 10 bullets, you can't use Autofire.
- Uses the **Autofire Skill** instead of the weapon's typical Skill.
- Uses the **Autofire Range Table** instead of the standard range table.
- **Cannot** be used to make an Aimed Shot.
- Targets with **REF 8+** can still choose to dodge.
- **Damage on hit:** Roll **2d6**, then multiply by the amount you beat the DV, up to a maximum multiplier of **3** (SMGs) or **4** (Assault Rifles).
- If **both dice come up 6**, you also inflict a **Critical Injury**. (p. 173)
- Armor reduces damage as normal.

### Autofire DVs Based on Range (p. 174)

| Weapon Type | 0-6 m/yds | 7-12 m/yds | 13-25 m/yds | 26-50 m/yds | 51-100 m/yds |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SMGs** | 15 | 13 | 15 | 20 | 25 |
| **Assault Rifle** | 17 | 16 | 15 | 13 | 15 |

---

## Suppressive Fire (p. 174)

- Costs an **Action** and **10 bullets**. If you don't have 10 bullets, you can't use Suppressive Fire.
- Everyone **on foot** within **25 m/yds**, **out of cover**, and **in your line of sight** must roll:

  **WILL + Concentration + 1d10 vs. your REF + Autofire Skill + 1d10**

- Anyone who **fails** must use their next **Move Action** to get into cover. If that Move Action is insufficient, they must also use the **Run Action** to get to cover or as close as possible. (p. 174)

---

## Shotgun Shells (p. 174)

- Shotguns can fire **Shotgun Shells** instead of Slugs.
- **Cannot** make an Aimed Shot with a Shotgun Shell.
- Make 1 Ranged Attack: **REF + Shoulder Arms + 1d10 vs. DV13**.
- If successful, **every target in front of you within 6 m/yds (3 squares)** that you can see takes **3d6 damage**.
- Damage rolled once for all targets. Armor reduces as normal.
- Targets with **REF 8+** can still individually choose to dodge. (p. 174)

---

## Arrows (p. 174)

- Loading an Arrow is part of attacking with a Bow or Crossbow; you **never need to Reload** using the Reload Action.
- **Basic Arrows** can always be **retrieved** after they are fired, making basic ammo almost a one-time purchase. (p. 174)

---

## Explosives (p. 174-175)

- All explosive weapons deal damage to **all targets (including terrain)** in a **10 m/yd x 10 m/yd area** (5 squares x 5 squares), centered on the intended target (a 2 m/yd x 2 m/yd square, not an individual). (p. 174)
- Roll damage **once** for all targets.
- If you roll **under** the DV, the GM decides where the explosive actually landed within that 10 m/yd square, and it damages a 10 m/yd x 10 m/yd area around that new point. (p. 175)
- Anyone with **REF 8+** can choose to individually dodge the blast by rolling higher than your original Check, placing themselves outside the blast area on success. (p. 175)
- An explosive blast **will not** damage a target behind cover that its damage would be insufficient to destroy. However, if the damage **would** destroy the cover, the target is no longer behind cover and takes full damage. (p. 175)

### Throwing Grenades (p. 177)

To throw an object (including grenades), use an Action to make a Ranged Attack:

**DEX + Athletics + 1d10** (max range 25 m/yds)

Use the **Grenade Launcher DV** entry on the range table. If throwing at a person who can dodge bullets (REF 8+), they can dodge. Grenades deal the **same damage** as when fired from a grenade launcher. (p. 177)

---

## Weapon Attachments (p. 97)

Each **Non-Exotic** Ranged Weapon has **three Attachment Slots**. You can combine multiple attachments in the same physical location, but must pay the slot cost independently. Equipping the same attachment twice does nothing. Attachments are weapon-type specific and cannot be easily retrofitted. (p. 97)

Specialized attachments are available in the Night Market Section (p. 342).

---

## Special Ammunition (p. 97)

All Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons can be loaded with non-Basic types of ammunition such as Incendiary Shells, Poisoned Arrows, Armor-Piercing Bullets, and others. Specialized ammunition and individual grenades are found in the Night Market Section (p. 344). You **cannot mix ammunition types** in a magazine. (p. 170)

---

## Exotic Weapons (p. 96)

Exotic Weapons are overly specialized or too unique to be easily described. They are typically variants of existing weapon types. All Exotic Weapons use the **Handgun Skill** and are **1 ROF**. They fire specialized ammunition unique to them. Exotic Weapons don't have Attachment Slots by default. (p. 96)

---

## Drawing, Dropping, and Stowing (p. 170)

- **Drawing** an easily accessible weapon into a free hand is **NOT an Action**.
- **Dropping** a held weapon to the ground is **NOT an Action**.
- **Stowing** a weapon on your person **IS an Action**.
- Exception: Equipping and dropping a **Shield** takes an **Action**. (p. 170)

---

## Reload (p. 170)

Use an Action to **fully reload and replace** a weapon's magazine with a single ammunition type. You **cannot mix** ammunition types in a magazine. (p. 170)

---

## Dodging Ranged Attacks (p. 172)

A Defender with **REF 8 or higher** can choose to attempt to dodge a Ranged Attack instead of using the range table DV:

**Defender's DEX + Evasion + 1d10** (becomes the DV the Attacker must beat)

This applies to single shots, Autofire, Shotgun Shells, Explosives, and thrown objects (where noted). (pp. 172-175)

---

## Prone and Ranged Combat (p. 169)

When **Prone**, you cannot use a Move Action until you use the **Get Up** Action (which costs your Action). (p. 169)

---

## Relevant Cyberware for Ranged Combat

The following cyberware directly affects ranged combat (see *cyberware.md* for full details):

- **Targeting Scope** (Cybereye): +1 to Ranged Attack Check. (p. 114)
- **TeleOptics** (Cybereye): Allows you to see detail to 800 m/yds. (p. 114)
- **Smartgun Link** (Neuralware): +1 to Ranged Attack Check when used with a linked weapon. (p. 113)
- **Interface Plugs** (Neuralware): Required for smartgun links and vehicle interfacing. (p. 113)
- **Kerenzikov Speedware** (Neuralware): +2 to Initiative. (p. 113)
- **Sandevistan Speedware** (Neuralware): +3 to Initiative. (p. 113)

## Vehicle Combat with Ranged Weapons (p. 191-192)

- Shooting a vehicle still requires hitting your shot using the range table. (p. 191)
- Vehicles **cannot dodge** attacks like a human, but while in a vehicle you can still dodge anything you could typically dodge on foot when targeted at **you** (not the vehicle). (p. 191)
- While in a vehicle, you can still be targeted through **glass**, which has **no HP** and provides **no cover**. (p. 191)
- Aiming for a **vehicle weak point**: Take your whole Action and a **-8 to your Check**. If successful, multiply the damage that gets through the vehicle's SP by **2**. (p. 191)
- Against a **moving vehicle**, you must beat **DV13** to hit the weak point (the -8 penalty still applies). (p. 192)
