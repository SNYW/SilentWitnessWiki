**Tags:** Character-Creation, Lifepath, GM-Tools, Rules


> Synthesized from: *Friday Night Firefight* (pp. 180-194), *Trauma Team* (pp. 219-231)

---

## Taking Damage (p. 186)

Whenever you take damage:

1. The Attacker **rolls damage** for their attack.
2. **Subtract your armor's SP** in the hit location from the damage. (If they didn't target your head with an Aimed Shot, the location is always **body**.) Subtract any remaining damage from your **Hit Points**.
3. If you took **any damage**, your armor on that location is **ablated** (SP reduced by 1) until repaired. (p. 186)

> Some damage sources (poisons, fire) bypass armor entirely. (p. 186)

### Head Shots (p. 170)

Aimed Shots to the **head** multiply the damage that gets through head armor by **2**. (See also: Cracked Skull Critical Injury, which changes this to **x3**, p. 189)

### Melee Weapon Damage vs. Armor (p. 176)

All **melee weapons** and **Martial Arts attacks** ignore **half** of the Defender's armor (**round up**). (p. 176, 179)

**Brawling attacks do NOT** ignore half armor. (p. 177)

---

## Armor Table (p. 98, 185)

| Armor Type | Description | SP | Armor Penalty | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Leathers** | Favored by Nomads and bikers | 4 | None | 20eb (Everyday) |
| **Kevlar** | Clothes, vests, jackets, business suits, bikinis | 7 | None | 50eb (Costly) |
| **Light Armorjack** | Kevlar and plastic meshes in fabric weave | 11 | None | 100eb (Premium) |
| **Bodyweight Suit** | Sintered armorgel skinsuit; stores Cyberdeck, supports Interface Plugs | 11 | None | 1,000eb (V. Expensive) |
| **Medium Armorjack** | Heavier Armorjack with solid plastic plating | 12 | -2 REF, DEX, and MOVE | 100eb (Premium) |
| **Heavy Armorjack** | Densest Armorjack; denser Kevlar and plastic/mesh layers | 13 | -2 REF, DEX, and MOVE | 500eb (Expensive) |
| **Flak** | 21st century flak vest and pants | 15 | -4 REF, DEX, and MOVE | 500eb (Expensive) |
| **Metalgear** | Stops almost anything; very heavy | 18 | -4 REF, DEX, and MOVE | 5,000eb (Luxury) |
| **Bulletproof Shield** | Transparent polycarbonate; 10 HP (takes up one arm) | 10 HP | None (uses one arm) | 100eb (Premium) |

### Armor Rules (p. 97, 185)

- Armor must be purchased individually for either the **head** or **body** location. (p. 97)
- Wearing heavier armor lowers **REF, DEX, and MOVE** by the most punishing Armor Penalty of armor you are wearing. This penalty is taken **only once** even if wearing armor on both body and head. The penalty can leave a Character at **MOVE 0** (completely immobile). (p. 185)
- SP gained by armor **does not stack**. Only your **highest source of SP** in a location determines your SP. (p. 185)
- **All worn armor in a location is ablated simultaneously** whenever you take damage. (p. 185)

---

## Wound States (p. 186, 220)

As you take damage, you cross Wound State Thresholds. Each new Wound State **replaces** the effect of the previous one. (p. 220)

| Wound State | Threshold | Effect | Stabilization DV |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lightly Wounded** | Less than Full HP | None | DV10 |
| **Seriously Wounded** | Less than 1/2 HP (round up) | **-2 to all Actions** | DV13 |
| **Mortally Wounded** | Less than 1 HP | **-4 to all Actions**, **-6 to MOVE** (minimum 1). Must make a **Death Save** at start of each Turn. Suffer a Critical Injury whenever damaged by a Melee or Ranged Attack. Death Save Penalty increases by 1 each time damaged. | DV15 (heals to 1 HP; patient is Unconscious for 1 minute) |
| **Dead** | One failed Death Save | Death. Never coming back. | N/A |

---

## Death Saves (p. 188, 222)

At the start of each Turn where you are **Mortally Wounded**, you must make a Death Save:

- Roll **1d10**. If you roll **under your BODY**, you live and can take your Turn.
- If you roll a **10**, you **automatically fail** your Death Save. (p. 188)
- Every time you roll a Death Save, your **Death Save Penalty increases by +1**, making each future save harder. (p. 188)
- This penalty adds up until you are brought back to **1 HP** by Stabilization, which **resets** your Death Save Penalty to your **Base Death Save Penalty**. (p. 188)
- Your Base Death Save Penalty can be increased by certain Critical Injuries. (p. 188)

**If you fail even a single Death Save, you die.** (p. 188)

---

## Critical Injuries (p. 187, 220-222)

### When Critical Injuries Occur (p. 187)

Whenever **two or more dice** rolled for damage from a Melee or Ranged Attack come up **6**, you've inflicted a **Critical Injury**. Roll **2d6** on the appropriate table until you get a Critical Injury the target isn't currently suffering. (p. 187)

- If not using an Aimed Shot to target the head, roll on **Critical Injuries to the Body** table. (p. 187)
- All Critical Injuries cause an **Injury Effect** and deal **5 Bonus Damage** directly to HP when suffered. (p. 187)
- Bonus Damage **doesn't ablate armor** and **isn't modified** by hit location. (p. 187)
- Critical Injuries and their Bonus Damage are inflicted **regardless** of whether any attack damage got through the target's SP. (p. 187)

### Mortally Wounded Characters and Critical Injuries (p. 188)

**Mortally Wounded** Characters suffer a Critical Injury whenever they are damaged by any Attack. In addition, their **Death Save Penalty increases by 1**. (p. 188)

### Critical Injuries to the Body (p. 187-188, 221-222)

## Cover (p. 182-184)

### Golden Rules of Cover (p. 182)

- You are in cover if you are **fully behind** something that could stop a bullet.
- If they have **line of sight** on you, you aren't in cover.
- There is **no "partial" cover**. It either stops a bullet or it doesn't.
- Enemies can **move** to re-establish line of sight, making cover pointless. (p. 182)

### Cover Hit Points (p. 183)

A 2 m/yd x 2 m/yd section (1 square) of cover can be attacked. At **0 HP**, cover is **destroyed**. Excess damage is lost and doesn't harm targets behind it (exception: explosives, p. 174). (p. 182)

| Type of Cover | Thick HP | Thin HP |
|---|---|---|
| **Steel** | 50 HP | 25 HP |
| **Stone** | 40 HP | 20 HP |
| **Bulletproof Glass** | 30 HP | 15 HP |
| **Concrete** | 25 HP | 10 HP |

---

## Using Shields (p. 183-184)

- Equipping and dropping a shield takes an **Action**. (p. 183)
- While wielding a shield with HP remaining, you are considered **in cover**. (p. 183)
- When attacked by a target you can see, you can **interpose the shield** between yourself and the attack. If you do, you **cannot dodge** at all, though a Ranged Attack can still miss. (p. 183)
- The **shield takes the entire attack** to its HP. (p. 183)
- At **0 HP**, the shield is **destroyed** (until repaired), cannot be used as cover, but remains equipped until you use an Action to drop it. (p. 184)

### Shield Table (p. 184)

| Shield Type | Description | HP | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bulletproof Shield** | Transparent polycarbonate shield | 10 HP | 100eb (Premium) |
| **Corpse Shield** | Shield made of meat (formerly a person) | Equal to the corpse's **BODY STAT** in life | Free (sort of) |

### Human Shields (p. 184-185)

- If you are the **Attacker** in a Grapple, you can use an Action to "equip" the Defender as a Human Shield (if not already wielding a shield), using the same hand used to Grapple them. (p. 184)
- While wielding a Human Shield, you are considered **in cover**.
- Human Shields **cannot block Melee Attacks** or Ranged Attacks targeted at your **head** with an Aimed Shot. (p. 184)
- Your Human Shield **cannot dodge** while equipped (even with REF 8+). (p. 185)
- You can **attack your own Human Shield** while equipped. (p. 185)
- A Human Shield who **dies** while equipped automatically becomes a shield with **HP equal to their BODY**. (p. 185)
- Unequipping a live Human Shield = ending the Grapple (no Action). Dropping a corpse shield costs an Action. (p. 185)

---

## Other Ways to Get Hurt (p. 180-182)

### Being on Fire (p. 180)

While **On Fire**, you take damage direct to HP at the end of your Turn until you use an **Action to put yourself out**. Armor is **not ablated**. Each Turn is 3 seconds. (p. 180)

| Intensity | Example | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Mild** | Wood Fire | **2 damage** direct to HP |
| **Strong** | Gasoline Fire | **4 damage** direct to HP |
| **Deadly** | Thermite | **6 damage** direct to HP |

### Drowning and Asphyxiation (p. 180)

- Characters can hold their breath for **BODY** minutes. (p. 180)
- When Drowning, at the beginning of each Turn you take your **BODY STAT directly to HP**. Ignores armor, doesn't ablate. (p. 180)
- **Asphyxiation** is treated like Drowning. Asphyxiating in **space** deals additional **1d6 damage** to INT, REF, and DEX at end of Turn. If **INT reaches 0**, you die. Damage reversed if you get air. (p. 180)

### Electrocution (p. 181)

- Immediately take **6d6 damage**. Soaked by armor as normal.
- If you don't move away, damage repeats at the end of each Turn starting with your next Turn. (p. 181)

### Exposure (p. 181)

- Prolonged extreme element exposure: **1d6 damage** directly to HP at end of each **day**.
- While exposed, even if Stabilized, you **cannot heal naturally**.
- Proper equipment negates exposure. (p. 181)

### Falling (p. 182)

- Falling Characters fall **40 m/yds** at end of their Turn. (p. 182)
- If an edge/ledge is nearby, one attempt: **DV15 Athletics Check** (no Check needed with Grapple Hand, Grapple Gun, etc.). (p. 182)
- Upon hitting ground after falling **10 m/yds or more**: **2d6 damage per 10 m/yds** (soaked by body armor). (p. 182)
- Unless they succeed a **DV15 Athletics Check**, also suffer **Broken Leg** Critical Injury. (p. 182)
- Characters with **2 Cyberlegs** do not take this damage or Critical Injury (unless fall exceeds **30 m/yds**). (p. 182)
- Falling off a skyscraper without a parachute = dead, don't bother rolling. (p. 182)

### Poisons (p. 182)

Roll **Resist Torture/Drugs** vs. poison DV. If you fail, suffer the effect. Armor is not ablated. (p. 182)

| Intensity | Examples | DV | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mild** | Belladonna, Toxic Waste | 11 | **1d6** damage direct to HP |
| **Strong** | Arsenic | 13 | **2d6** damage direct to HP |
| **Deadly** | Biotoxin, Designer Poison, Stonefish Venom | 15 | **2d6** damage direct to HP |

### Drugs (p. 182)

Roll **Resist Torture/Drugs** vs. drug DV. If you fail, suffer the effect. (p. 182)

| Intensity | Examples | DV | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mild** | Alcohol | 11 | Inebriation |
| **Strong** | Sodium Pentothal | 13 | Suggestibility |
| **Deadly** | Designer Drug | 15 | Designer's Intention |

> For full street drug mechanics (Black Lace, Blue Glass, Boost, Smash, Synthcoke), see pp. 227-229.

### Radiation (p. 182)

- **Low level**: Won't kill immediately; over time causes sickness and potentially cancer (GM interpretation). (p. 182)
- **High level**: Every Turn in the hot zone, treated as **Mildly On Fire** (2 damage/Turn direct to HP) except you **cannot** use an Action to put yourself out while in the zone. (p. 182)
- **Extremely hot zone** (leaking reactor): Treated as **Deadly On Fire** (6 damage/Turn direct to HP). (p. 182)

---

## Stabilization and Healing (p. 222-226)

### Stabilization (p. 222)

To begin the natural healing process, you must first receive stabilization. Stabilization takes an **Action** and is rolled:

**TECH + First Aid Skill or Paramedic Skill + 1d10**

| Wound State | Stabilization DV |
|---|---|
| Lightly Wounded | DV10 |
| Seriously Wounded | DV13 |
| Mortally Wounded | DV15 |

### After Stabilization (p. 222-223)

- The target heals **BODY HP per full day of rest** (spending the majority of each day taking it easy with only light activity). (p. 222)
- If the patient **pushes it**, they gain no HP that day, wounds reopen, and they need to be stabilized again. (p. 223)

### Mortally Wounded Stabilization (p. 223)

A Mortally Wounded target who receives successful stabilization is immediately healed to **1 HP** and is **Unconscious** for **1 minute**. Their Death Save Penalty resets to their Base Death Save Penalty. (p. 223)

### Treatment (p. 223)

- Removes the Injury Effect **permanently**. (p. 223)
- Each attempt takes **4 hours**. (p. 223)
- You **cannot** do a Treatment on yourself. (p. 223)

### Healing Skills (p. 223)

| **First Aid** | Can Stabilize. Can Quick Fix only the most common Critical Injuries. Always trained to at least +2. (p. 223) |
| **Paramedic (x2)** | Can Stabilize. Can Quick Fix or Treat all but the deadliest Critical Injuries. (p. 223) |
| **Surgery** | Can Treat even the deadliest Critical Injuries. Only available to Medtechs through their Role Ability, Medicine. (p. 223) |

### Critical Injuries and Cybertech (p. 224)

If you suffer a Critical Injury to a section replaced with cyberware (Cyberarm, Cyberleg, Cybereye, Cyberaudio, etc.), you still suffer the Effect and Bonus Damage, but you can use the **Cybertech Skill** for Quick Fix or Treatment in place of First Aid, Paramedic, or Surgery at the same DV and time. (p. 224)
