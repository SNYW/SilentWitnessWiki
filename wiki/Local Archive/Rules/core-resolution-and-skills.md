## Statistics (STATs)

Every Character has 10 primary Statistics. (p. 72)

| STAT | Abbreviation | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Intelligence | **INT** | How well you can problem-solve, be aware, and learn |
| Reflexes | **REF** | Reaction time and coordination for combat and other actions |
| Dexterity | **DEX** | Overall physical agility, balance, and ability to move quickly |
| Technique | **TECH** | Ability to manipulate tools and equipment |
| Cool | **COOL** | Willpower, courage, and ability to stay calm under pressure |
| Willpower | **WILL** | Determination, mental resilience, and ability to resist stress |
| Luck | **LUCK** | Pool of points spent to boost Skill Checks; refills each session |
| Move | **MOVE** | How fast you move in combat; Move Action = **MOVE x 2** m/yds |
| Body | **BODY** | Physical strength, toughness, and resilience |
| Empathy | **EMP** | Ability to relate to and care for others; linked to Humanity |

### STAT Generation Methods (p. 74)

- **Streetrat (Templates):** Roll **1d10** on the template table for your Role. Stats are pre-assigned.
- **Edgerunner (Fast and Dirty):** Distribute **62 points** among the 10 STATs. No STAT may be below **2** or above **8** at creation.
- **Complete Package (Calculated):** Distribute **62 points** among the 10 STATs. No STAT may be below **2** or above **8** at creation.

## Derived Statistics

### Hit Points (HP) (p. 79)

**HP = 10 + (5 x [Average of BODY and WILL, rounded up])**

| | BODY 2 | BODY 3 | BODY 4 | BODY 5 | BODY 6 | BODY 7 | BODY 8 | BODY 9 | BODY 10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **WILL 2** | 20 | 25 | 25 | 30 | 30 | 35 | 35 | 40 | 40 |
| **WILL 3** | 25 | 25 | 30 | 30 | 35 | 35 | 40 | 40 | 45 |
| **WILL 4** | 25 | 30 | 30 | 35 | 35 | 40 | 40 | 45 | 45 |
| **WILL 5** | 30 | 30 | 35 | 35 | 40 | 40 | 45 | 45 | 50 |
| **WILL 6** | 30 | 35 | 35 | 40 | 40 | 45 | 45 | 50 | 50 |
| **WILL 7** | 35 | 35 | 40 | 40 | 45 | 45 | 50 | 50 | 55 |
| **WILL 8** | 35 | 40 | 40 | 45 | 45 | 50 | 50 | 55 | 55 |
| **WILL 9** | 40 | 40 | 45 | 45 | 50 | 50 | 55 | 55 | 60 |
| **WILL 10** | 40 | 45 | 45 | 50 | 50 | 55 | 55 | 60 | 60 |

- **Seriously Wounded Threshold** = Half of total HP (rounded up). (p. 79)
- **Death Save** = **BODY** Statistic. (p. 79)

### Humanity (HUM) (p. 81)

For every point of **EMP**, the Character has **10 points of Humanity**.

| EMP | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **HUM** | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 90 | 100 |

Every time you lose enough Humanity that the tens place changes (e.g. 50 to 46), your **EMP** is effectively lowered to match the tens place (EMP 5 becomes EMP 4). (p. 81)

If **HUM** drops below zero, the Character enters **Cyberpsychosis**. (See *Therapy and You*, p. 229)

---

## Distance and Movement (p. 126)

Cyberpunk RED measures everything in **meters or yards** (treated interchangeably). On a grid, each **1-inch square = 2 m/yds**. (p. 126)

Three scales of movement:

| Scale | Use |
|---|---|
| **Narrative Movement** | Real-world terms (MPH/KPH); cars, walking speeds |
| **Figurative Movement** | Comparing one MOVE STAT to another for simple speed contests |
| **Literal Movement** | Exact distance in combat; **Move Action = MOVE x 2** m/yds or **MOVE** squares |

### Travel Speeds (p. 126)

| Travel Method | MPH | KPH |
|---|---|---|
| Walking | 2.5 | 4 |
| Running | 5 | 11 |

### Other Forms of Movement (p. 169)

- **Swimming, Climbing, Jumping with a running start** all cost **2 m/yds of movement per 1 m/yd** traveled (or 2 squares per 1 square).
- **Jumping from standing** clears **half the distance** of a running start.

---

## Time and Initiative (p. 126)

Two ways of measuring time:

- **Roleplaying Time:** Works like real life. Fluid and narrative.
- **Combat Time:** Divided into **Turns** (~3 seconds each). All Turns in a combat cycle = **1 Round** (~3 seconds).

### Initiative (p. 126, 168)

When combat starts, everyone rolls:

**Initiative = REF + 1d10**

- All participants are placed in an **Initiative Queue** in descending order.
- Resolve ties by rolling again.
- Combat proceeds in Initiative Queue order. When the bottom is reached, start again from the top.

---

## Your Turn (p. 127, 168)

**Your Turn = 1 Move Action + 1 Action**

### Actions in Brief (p. 168-169)

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| **Move Action** | Move up to **MOVE x 2** m/yds (or **MOVE** squares). |
| **Attack** | Make a Melee or Ranged Attack. |
| **Choke** | Choke an opponent you have Grabbed. |
| **Equip/Drop Shield** | Takes an Action. |
| **Get into a Vehicle** | Get into an unlocked vehicle or one you have the key for. |
| **Get Up** | Stand after being Prone. While Prone, you cannot use a Move Action. |
| **Grab** | Grab and hold an opponent, take an object they hold, or escape a grapple. |
| **Hold Action** | Hold an Action until a specified event or Initiative number. Must declare Action, target, and trigger. Cannot Hold across Rounds. Move Actions and NET Actions cannot be Held. |
| **Human Shield** | Equip a Grabbed opponent as a Human Shield (requires you are not already wielding a shield). |
| **Reload** | Fully reload and replace a weapon's magazine with a single ammo type. Cannot mix ammo types. |
| **Run** | Take an additional Move Action (only if you already took a Move Action this Turn). |
| **Stabilize** | Stabilize a target to begin natural healing or save a Mortally Wounded Character. |
| **Start a Vehicle** | Start a vehicle (requires key). |
| **Throw** | Throw a grabbed opponent to the ground or throw a held object. |
| **Use NET Actions** | Perform multiple NET Actions inside the NET (Netrunner only). |
| **Use an Object** | Manipulate an object that doesn't require a Skill (~3 seconds). Drawing an easily accessible weapon into a free hand is NOT an Action. Dropping a held weapon (not a shield) is NOT an Action. Stowing a weapon IS an Action. |
| **Use a Skill** | Use a Skill to accomplish a quick task (3 seconds max). Longer tasks require multiple Turns. |
| **Vehicle Maneuver** | Focus entirely on a dangerous driving maneuver (costs your Action). |

### Split Movement and ROF (p. 169)

You can take your Action **in the middle of** your Move Action and keep moving afterwards. Weapons with **2 ROF** can also be split across movement. You can never make more than **2 Attack Checks** as part of an Action, and you cannot attack with two **1 ROF** weapons in the same Action even if dual-wielding. (p. 169)

---

## Skill Check Resolution (p. 128-130)

### Opposed Checks

**Attacker's STAT + Skill + 1d10 vs. Defender's STAT + Skill + 1d10**

In case of a tie, the **Defender always wins**. (p. 130)

### Checks Against a Difficulty Value (DV)

**STAT + Skill + 1d10 vs. Difficulty Value (DV)**

### Difficulty Values (DV) Table (p. 130)

| Difficulty | DV | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Simple** | 9 | Most people can do without thinking |
| **Everyday** | 13 | Most people can do without special training |
| **Difficult** | 15 | Difficult without training or natural talent |
| **Professional** | 17 | Requires actual training; considered professional |
| **Heroic** | 21 | Only the best of the best can pull this off |
| **Incredible** | 24 | Among the very best professionally; truly Olympian |
| **Legendary** | 29 | People write stories about this; spoken of for years |

### Critical Success (p. 131)

When you roll a **natural 10** on your **d10**, roll another **1d10** and add the result. A second 10 does **not** trigger another Critical Success.

### Critical Failure (p. 131)

When you roll a **natural 1** on your **d10**, roll another **1d10** and **subtract** the result from your total. A second 1 does **not** trigger another Critical Failure.

> Note: A highly skilled Character can still succeed after a Critical Failure, and a high DV can still defeat a Character who achieves a Critical Success. (p. 131)

### Negative Modifier Examples (p. 131)

Modifiers are cumulative. (p. 131)

| Condition | Modifier |
|---|---|
| Night or low lighting conditions | -1 |

| Extremely drunk or sedated | -4 |
| Trying to perform task secretly | -4 |
| Task obscured by smoke, darkness | -4 |

> Positive Modifiers generally come from gear, cyberware, Role Abilities, or drugs. (p. 131)

### Complementary Skills (p. 131)

At GM discretion, a good roll in one Skill may grant a **+1 bonus** to a subsequent related Skill Check. This **+1** only affects one subsequent attempt and does **not** stack. Another Character can make the complementary Check.

### Taking Extra Time (p. 131)

When the GM tells you how long a task takes, you can gain a single **+1 bonus** by taking **four times longer**.

### When You Don't Have A Skill (p. 131)

If you don't have the required Skill, you roll only **STAT + 1d10**. No Skill value is added.

### Using Your LUCK (p. 131)

Before you roll, you can spend points from your **LUCK Pool** (equal to your LUCK Statistic, refills at the start of each game session). Each point spent adds **+1** to the roll.
