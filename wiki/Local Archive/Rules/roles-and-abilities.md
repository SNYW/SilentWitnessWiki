## Multiclassing (p. 143)

You cannot start with two Roles at Character creation. You can change Roles after completing at least **Rank 4** in your current Role by purchasing Rank 1 in the new Role with **Improvement Points**. You retain all features of your previous Role and can continue increasing its Rank, but you are now seen as your new Role. You are locked from multiclassing again until the latest Role is at least **Rank 4**. (p. 143)

## Rockerboy: Charismatic Impact (p. 144-146)

Rockerboys influence others through sheer force of personality -- music, art, dance, poetry, or physical presence. Their Role Ability, **Charismatic Impact**, works only on **Fans**.

### Making Fans (p. 144)

Outside of combat, roll to convert non-fans (who don't actively dislike you) into Fans:

**Charismatic Impact + 1d10 vs. DV**

| Target | DV |
|---|---|

| Huge Group | DV12 |

The GM determines if someone already met is a Fan.

### Using Charismatic Impact (p. 144)

When asking a favor of Fans, the GM checks if the favor is within the Rockerboy's current Rank capability. If so, the Rockerboy rolls **Charismatic Impact + 1d10** against the DV for the group size (DV8 Single / DV10 Small / DV12 Huge). On failure, the same favor cannot be asked of those fans for **1 week**. (p. 144)

### Charismatic Impact Ranks (pp. 144-146)
