# CYBERWARE

> Synthesized from: *Putting the Cyber into the Punk* (pp. 107-120)

---

## General Rules (pp. 108-112)

### Installation Levels (p. 110)

| Level | Description | Surgery DV (Medtech) | Hospital Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mall** | Walk-in bio-mod shop; like ear-piercing | DV13 | 100eb (Premium) |
| **Clinic** | Actual Medtech in a medical surgery clinic; most ripperdocs | DV15 | 500eb (Expensive) |
| **Hospital** | Major surgery, full hospital facility required | DV17 | 1,000eb (V. Expensive) |

### Key Rules

- Benefits from **multiple installations of the same cyberware do not stack** unless otherwise noted. (p. 112)
- You **can't install cyberware** if you're suffering a **Critical Injury related to it**. (p. 111)
- At Character Generation, Humanity Loss is **preset**. After Character Generation, HL is determined by the **dice in parentheses**. (p. 112)
- Installation surgery is always **included at no extra charge**, including at Character Generation. (p. 110)
- You **can't do installation surgery on yourself** unless the cyberware's typical installation is **Mall**. (p. 226)

### Humanity Loss and Cyberpsychosis (pp. 109-110)

- Every **10 points of Humanity = 1 EMP**. Losing Humanity lowers EMP when the tens place drops. (p. 81)
- If **HUM drops below zero**, the Character enters **Cyberpsychosis**. (p. 109)
- **Medical-Grade Cyberware** (replacement-only, no enhancement) has **no Humanity cost**. (p. 110)
- **Bodysculpting** (therapeutic body modification) has **no Humanity cost**. (p. 110)
- Therapy can restore lost Humanity (see *damage-and-healing.md*). (p. 229)
