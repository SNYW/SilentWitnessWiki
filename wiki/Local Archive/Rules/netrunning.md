# NETRUNNING

> Synthesized from: *Netrunning* (pp. 196-218), *Getting It Done* (p. 148)

---

## Prerequisites (p. 196)

To Netrun you need:

1. **Interface Role Ability** (Netrunner only). Without it, you cannot Netrun. (p. 197)
2. **Neural Link** with **Interface Plugs** (cyberware). (p. 196)
3. **Cyberdeck** loaded with Programs and/or Hardware. (p. 196)
4. **Virtuality Goggles** (or Cybereyes with Virtuality). Without them, you are effectively **Unconscious** in Meatspace while jacked in. (p. 197)
5. Be within **6 m/yds** of a NET Architecture **access point** (blocked by walls). (p. 198)

---

## Meat Actions vs. NET Actions (p. 197)

On your Turn, you can take either:
- **A Meat Action** (a non-Move Action that takes place in Meatspace), OR
- **As many NET Actions** as your Interface Rank allows.

No matter which you choose, you still get your **Move Action**. (p. 197)

### NET Actions per Turn (p. 197)

| Interface Rank | 1-3 | 4-6 | 7-9 | 10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **NET Actions** | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

---

## List of NET Actions (pp. 198-201)

| NET Action | Description |
|---|---|
| **Jack In / Out** | Enter or safely leave a NET Architecture when within 6 m/yds of an access point |
| **Use Interface Ability** | Use one of your Interface Abilities (all except Scanner require a NET Action) |
| **Activate / Deactivate Program** | Activate or Deactivate one of your Programs |
| **Miscellaneous** | Anything else the GM allows in the NET (rare; usually costs a NET Action) |

### What Is NOT a NET Action (p. 198)

- **Moving** within a NET Architecture (unlimited movement per Turn, blocked by Passwords) (p. 198)
- **Saving a copy of a File** to your Cyberdeck (p. 198)

---

## Jacking In and Out (p. 198)

- **Jack In:** Use a NET Action within range (6 m/yds) of an access point. Prerequisite for doing anything in an Architecture. (p. 198)
- **Jack Out (Safe):** Use a NET Action while within range. Resets all Architecture defenses. You must re-enter from the same access point to try again. All your Programs leave with you. (p. 198)
- **Leaving range while Jacked In (Unsafe):** You suffer the effect of **all remaining enemy Black ICE** you've encountered (but not Derezzed) in the Architecture before you get out. (p. 198)

---

## Interface Abilities (pp. 199-201)

Resolution for all Interface Abilities (except Zap):

**Interface + 1d10 vs. DV**

### Scanner (p. 199)

Uses a **Meat Action** (not a NET Action). Find the Meatspace location of access points to NET Architectures in an area. The higher your Check, the more you find from further away. (p. 199)

### Backdoor (p. 199)

Uses a **NET Action**. Break through **Passwords** blocking your progress. If you already know the password, you pass through automatically. (p. 199)

### Cloak (p. 199)

Uses a **NET Action**. Hide traces of your presence and any Virus you left. The DV for another Netrunner to discover your actions via Pathfinder = your **Cloak Check result**. If you don't Cloak before Jacking Out, any Netrunner can automatically discover your actions. (p. 199)

### Control (p. 200)

Uses a **NET Action**. Take control of things attached to the Architecture via a **Control Node** (cameras, drones, turrets, elevators, sprinklers, etc.). Each Control Node has a DV. Once you have control, operating each individual thing requires a **separate NET Action**, and can be done from anywhere in the Architecture. Each Control Node can only be activated **once per Turn**. (p. 200)

To wrest control from another Netrunner or Demon: DV = their original Control Check. You lose control of all Control Nodes when you Jack Out. (p. 200)

### Eye-Dee (p. 200)

Uses a **NET Action**. Identify a piece of data (like a File) and learn its value. Some Files have a DV that must be beaten. (p. 200)

### Pathfinder (p. 200)

Uses a **NET Action**. Partially reveals the "map" of the Architecture. You can see a number of floors equal to your Check, or up to the first obstruction with a DV higher than your Pathfinder Check, whichever comes first. Does not reveal DVs. (p. 200)

### Slide (p. 201)

Uses a **NET Action**. Attempt to flee combat with a single **Non-Demon** Black ICE:

**Interface + 1d10 vs. Black ICE's Perception + 1d10**

On success, escape to an adjacent floor (not past Passwords). The Black ICE stops following and becomes "lying in wait" where pursuit ended. Only **once per Turn**. Cannot Slide preemptively. **Cannot Slide from Demons.** (p. 201)

### Virus (p. 201)

Uses **multiple NET Actions** (GM determines how many). Must be at the **lowest level** of the Architecture. Leave a custom Virus to perform up to **2 actions/changes**. Describe to the GM what you want; they set DV and NET Action cost. More powerful = higher DV and more Actions. The DV to destroy the Virus = your **Virus Check result**. This is the **only way** to make a persistent change to an Architecture. (p. 201)

### Zap (p. 202)

Uses a **NET Action**. Basic attack against a Program or enemy Netrunner:

**Interface + 1d10 vs. Program's DEF + 1d10 or enemy Netrunner's Interface + 1d10**

On success, deal **1d6 damage** to the Program's REZ or directly to the Netrunner's brain. (p. 202)

---

## NET Combat (p. 202)

**Your Interface + Program ATK + 1d10**
or **Black ICE ATK + 1d10**
**vs.**
**Target's Interface + 1d10** or **Program DEF / Black ICE DEF + 1d10**

On a hit, the target suffers the **Effect** of the attacking Program. Programs targeting a specific type (Anti-Personnel, Anti-Program) are only effective against that type. (p. 202)

### Defeating a Program (p. 202)

- **Derezzed** (0 REZ): Still installed but useless. Spend **2 NET Actions** (Deactivate then Activate) to restore full REZ. (p. 202)
- **Destroyed**: Permanently erased. Must buy a new one. (p. 202)

---

## Programs (pp. 202-205)

Activating or Deactivating a Program is a **NET Action**. Each loaded Program can only be Activated **once per Meatspace Round**. Multiple copies of the same Program can be run simultaneously and their effects **stack** (unless noted). Installing/Uninstalling a Program takes **1 hour**. (p. 202)

### Three Kinds of Non-Black ICE Programs (p. 202)

## Black ICE (pp. 204-208)

Black ICE are deadly Programs that hunt targets across an Architecture. They take **2 deck slots** (non-Black ICE take 1). Activating/Deactivating is a NET Action. Install/Uninstall takes 1 hour. (p. 204)

### Black ICE Types (p. 205)

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| **Anti-Personnel Black ICE** | Hunt down and kill Netrunners |
| **Anti-Program Black ICE** | Hunt down and destroy a Netrunner's Rezzed Programs |
| **Demon** | Intelligent Systems that operate Control Nodes to defend a physical space (too big for Cyberdecks) |

### Encountering Black ICE (p. 205)

When you encounter enemy Black ICE lying in wait:

**Your Interface + SPEED bonus + 1d10 vs. Black ICE's SPEED + 1d10**

If the Black ICE wins, you (or a random active Program for Anti-Program ICE) suffer its effect immediately. It then enters the Initiative Queue at the **top** (one above the previously highest). On each Turn, it attacks once. (p. 205)

Black ICE chases its target through the **entire Architecture** until Derezzed or eluded via Slide. Anti-Program Black ICE follows even if the Netrunner has no Programs Rezzed. (p. 205)

### Using Your Own Black ICE (p. 205)

Activate via NET Action in two ways:
1. **Lie in wait** at your current floor (not during combat).
2. **During combat**, targeting a valid target. Enters Initiative Queue at the top. (p. 205)

To reassign target: Deactivate (NET Action) then Activate again (NET Action). The GM plays all Black ICE Turns. (p. 205)

## Doing a Netrun: Architecture Structure (pp. 209-211)

A NET Architecture is like an **elevator**. Each floor has something waiting behind the "door": Programs, Black ICE, Passwords, Files, Control Nodes, or other Netrunners. (p. 209)

- You can descend as many floors as you want per Turn (movement is free), but cannot skip floors. (p. 209)
- You are blocked by **Passwords** and other NET obstructions until you Backdoor them. (p. 209)

### Architecture Difficulty Ratings (p. 210)

| Parameter | Basic | Standard | Uncommon | Advanced |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Password / File / Control Node DV** | DV6 | DV8 | DV10 | DV12 |
| **Interface for a fighting chance** | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 |
| **Interface that might die before bottom** | N/A | 2 or less | 4 or less | 6 or less |

### Building a NET Architecture (pp. 210-212)

**Step 0:** Choose Difficulty Rating. (p. 210)

**Step 1:** Roll **3d6** for total floors. Roll **1d10**; on 7+, the Architecture has a branch. Roll again for additional branches. Split floors among branches. A branch can't start until after the 2nd floor of the main branch. The longest branch is the "bottom" (where Viruses can be left). (p. 210)

**Step 2:** Fill in the Architecture. First 2 floors use the **Lobby Table**. Remaining floors use the **Body Table** for the chosen Difficulty Rating. Re-roll duplicate Program or Password entries. (p. 211)

**Step 3:** Fit to the world. Assign meaning to Files and Control Nodes. Place Demons if needed. (p. 211)

### NET Architecture Lobby Table (First 2 Floors) (p. 211)

| Roll (1d6) | Floor Contents |
|---|---|
| 1 | File DV6 |
| 2 | Password DV6 |

## Notes on Electronics and Netrunning (p. 209)

Many electronics do **not** have NET Architectures because they are analog or operate entirely on the CitiNet and memory chips (e.g., Agents, video cameras). These can be countered with **Electronics/Security Tech** but **cannot be hacked** with Interface. Similarly, **Cyberware** cannot be hacked with Interface; it is governed by the **Cybertech** Skill. (p. 209)
