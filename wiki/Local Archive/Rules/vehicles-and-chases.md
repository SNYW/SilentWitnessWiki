## Structural Damage Points (SDP) (p. 191)

- As long as a vehicle has at least **1 SDP**, it can still move.
- When SDP reaches **0**, the vehicle is **Destroyed**: it is no longer cover and cannot move unless repaired with the appropriate **Vehicle Tech Skill**.
- Vehicles **cannot dodge** attacks like a human, but occupants can still dodge attacks targeted at them (not the vehicle) if they could normally dodge on foot.
- Passengers can be targeted **through the glass**, which has **no HP** and provides **no cover**. (Bulletproof Glass is a Nomad upgrade; see `roles-and-abilities.md`.)
- Shooting a vehicle with a ranged weapon still requires hitting via the range table.

---

## Aiming for Vehicle Weak Points (p. 191)

Every vehicle has weak points (tires, engine, gas cap, etc.). As an **Action**, you can aim a single shot or Melee Attack at a weak point:

- **-8 penalty** to your Check.
- If successful, **multiply damage that gets through SP by 2**.
- For a **Melee Attack against a stationary vehicle**: vehicles can't dodge and you automatically hit, so there's no reason not to aim for a weak point. But the **-8 penalty still applies**.
- For a **moving vehicle**: you must beat **DV13** to hit the weak point, and the **-8 penalty** still applies.

---

## Getting Your Vehicle Started (p. 191)

- **Getting into** a vehicle is an **Action**.
- **Getting out** of a vehicle is just **movement** (not an Action).
- **Starting** a vehicle is an **Action**. **Stopping** a vehicle is an **Action**.
- If you have **Interface Plugs**, part of this Action can include connecting/disconnecting them. Using Interface Plugs to drive means you can **drive with no hands**. Without Interface Plugs, **one hand must be used for driving** and can't be used for anything else.
- If you take your hand off the wheel, at the start of your next Turn you automatically **Lose Control of the Vehicle**.
- You **cannot** get into a car and drive off in the same Turn.

### When a Vehicle is Started, Three Things Happen:

1. The **driver** is placed immediately at the **top of the Initiative Queue**.
2. The vehicle's **MOVE** effectively becomes the driver's **MOVE**. Any penalty the driver had to their MOVE doesn't affect the vehicle's movement.
3. The driver **cannot use the Run Action**.

---

## Basic Driving (p. 192)

- If your **REF + Relevant Control Skill > 9**: Basic driving doesn't require your Action. It operates like a Move Action, except your MOVE is much higher.
- If your **REF + Relevant Control Skill ≤ 9**: Basic driving requires your Action every Turn. Attempt **DV10 Check** using **REF + Relevant Control Skill + 1d10** to maintain control. Failure = **Losing Control**.

---

## Maneuvers (p. 192)

The GM decides when non-basic driving requires a **Maneuver**. Maneuvers require **both your Action and your Move Action**.

**Roll:** REF + Relevant Control Skill + 1d10 vs. DV

Failure = **Lose Control of the Vehicle**.

| Maneuver | DV |
|---|---|
| Swerve | 13 |
| Sharp Turn | 13 |
| Emergency Stop | 13 |
| Landing (Air Vehicle) | 13 |
| Bootleg Turn | 17 |
| Do a Jump | 17 |
| Aerobatic Maneuver (Air Vehicle) | 17 |

---

## Losing Control of the Vehicle (p. 192)

If you lose control, the **GM decides your entire movement** for that Turn. If your vehicle impacts something, it is treated as if you had **rammed** it.

---

## Ramming (p. 192)

When you drive a vehicle into something with HP (pedestrian, cover, or another vehicle):

- Both your vehicle and the target take **6d6 damage**.
- Everyone involved (pedestrians or persons in any involved vehicle) suffers the **Whiplash Critical Injury**.
- If the target's HP reaches **0** from this damage, your movement can **continue**. Otherwise, your vehicle **must stop**.
- You can always continue moving after hitting a pedestrian, but if they have more than **0 HP** after impact, they can choose to be **on top of your vehicle**.

### Dodging a Ramming Vehicle (p. 192)

- **DV13** Check: **DEX + Evasion + 1d10**
- If successful, the dodger can choose to be **on top of the vehicle** if they want.
