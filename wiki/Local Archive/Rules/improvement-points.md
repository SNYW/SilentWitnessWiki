# Improvement Points

---

## Overview (p. 409)

Players improve their Characters by accumulating **Improvement Points (I.P.)**. I.P. is earned after each game session and spent to raise **Skill Levels** or **Role Ability Ranks**. You cannot skip Levels/Ranks — you must progress one step at a time.

## Playstyle Types (p. 410)

Cyberpunk RED uses **Playstyle-Based Improvement**. Each player identifies their primary and secondary playstyle via a quiz after character creation. The GM awards I.P. based on how well the player performed according to their playstyle.

| Playstyle | Description |
|---|---|
| **Warrior** | Combat-oriented. Wants the strongest fighter, best weapons, and combat abilities. |
| **Socializer** | Group-experience oriented. Tells jokes, records stories, takes supportive roles in and out of game. |
| **Explorer** | Discovery-oriented. Finds new places, makes alliances, solves non-combat puzzles and mysteries. |
| **Roleplayer** | Character-accuracy oriented. Elaborate backgrounds, personal props, "acting out" important scenes. |

## Earning Improvement Points (pp. 410-412)

After each session, the GM awards I.P. based on **Group performance** (if the mission was completed) or **individual Playstyle performance** (if unfinished). The GM can also award from any playstyle column if a player did something standout.
