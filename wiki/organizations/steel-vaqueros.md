## Overview

The Steel Vaqueros are a nomad pack originating from Salinas in Northern California. During the Time of the Red (2040s), they were one of the primary nomad groups operating in the Night City region, known for their relatively honest business practices and willingness to take on new members.

## History

### Origins

The Steel Vaqueros started as a nomad pack from Salinas in Northern California. Their ragtag convoys made the coastal highway run from the nearby Santa Cruz agriplots, all the way down to the cities of Southern California. The Vaqueros were smart and relatively honest, and they took in anyone who displayed skills, dependability, and who could keep up with the rest of the pack.

### Time of the Red (2040s)

During the Time of the Red, the Steel Vaqueros had supply deals with several reclaimer groups in and around Night City, as well as several nomad groups found around the metropolis. They recruited locals to act as junior members and "hold down the fort" while the rest of the pack was on the road.

The Vaqueros were major vehicle suppliers for the Honest Hiro's Used Cars establishment, which was a well-known vehicle dealership in the Night City area during the RED era.

### Operations

The Steel Vaqueros maintained a presence in the Badlands east of Night City, using it as a base for their convoy operations along the coast. Their operations included:

- Running supply convoys between Northern California agriplots and Southern California
- Supply deals with reclaimer groups in the Night City region
- Vehicle trafficking through connections with Honest Hiro's Used Cars
- Recruiting local Night City residents as junior members
