# Tyger Claws

**Type:** Guardian Gang / Combat Gang  
**Territory:** Japantown (Old Japantown), Watson Development  
**Threat Level:** Very High  

## Overview

The Tyger Claws are a formidable gang with roots stretching back to the 2020s. Originally an Arasaka-backed motorcycle club, they evolved into one of Night City's most powerful criminal organizations during the Time of the Red. By the 2040s, they control significant territory in Japantown and Watson Development, owning more businesses than any other gang in the city.

## History

### Origins (2020s)

The Tyger Claws began as an Arasaka-backed motorcycle club operating in the original Japantown and surrounding residential areas. By 2020, they had grown into a small combat gang, protected by Arasaka financing. Their members used enhanced reflex boosters, cyberware, and martial arts as their preferred weapons.

### The Night City Holocaust (2023)

After the nuclear blast of 2023, the Night City Holocaust, the megacorp Arasaka was kicked out of North America. The tattered remains of the Tyger Claws—who had been used as a proxy gang by Arasaka—were left to their own devices.

### Reconstruction Era (2030s-2040s)

The surviving Tyger Claws were soon contacted by the Night City Co-Prosperity Sphere (NCCS)—a recently formed conglomerate of Japanese-based corporations. Led by famous actor Shinobu Nakagawa, they were directed to the Watson Development in northern Night City, where the NCCS reformed them into a guardian gang.

During the Time of the Red, the Tyger Claws:
- Established control over portions of Japantown
- Built a network of合法 businesses as fronts
- Developed connections with Arasaka upper management
- Expanded into human trafficking and prostitution

### 2045 Status

By 2045, the Tyger Claws have grown into one of the largest gangs in Night City. They maintain a strong presence in the reconstructed Japantown district and have expanded their criminal enterprises throughout the city.

## Organization Structure

### Philosophy

The Tyger Claws operate with a Yakuza-like business philosophy. Crossing the lowest-level member can cause a quick and violent reaction from the entire gang, but if they get what they want, everything should be fine.

The gang's leadership believes business is preferable to war in the long run, though many rank-and-file members are sadistic brutes prone to violence. The gang frowns upon unauthorized violence that could attract unwanted attention, but will swiftly avenge any member harmed by outsiders.

### Leadership Structure
- **Unknown Boss** — Current leadership (2045)
- **Kazuo Shinjo** — High-ranking member in 2077
- Various Wakagashira (lieutenants)

### Membership Requirements
Members are easily recognized by their Asian luminous tattoos. Tyger foot soldiers favor:
- Fast street bikes
- Katanas and tantos
- Cyberware including reflex boosters, augmented cyberlimbs, pain editors, and ECM systems disguised as tattoos

## Activities

### Sources of Income

The Tyger Claws make money through:
- **Human trafficking and prostitution** — Primary income source

- **Legal businesses** — Bars, restaurants, braindance clubs, brothels, and casinos (many as fronts)
- **Money laundering**
- **Hit jobs** — Members hire out as mercenaries

### Business Holdings

The Tyger Claws own more businesses in Night City than any other gang. Many are registered as legal businesses but act as fronts for illegal operations. Their establishments cater to both regular citizens and corporate clients who visit to "blow off steam."
