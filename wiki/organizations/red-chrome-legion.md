**Threat Rating:** High

## Overview

The Red Chrome Legion is a neo-fascist boostergang that operates in the Combat Zones of Night City during the Time of the Red. Originally formed as a posergang by edgy teenagers who enjoyed cosplaying as Nazis, the gang eventually became what they pretended to be, embracing a radical neo-fascist ideology.

## History

### Origins (2020s)

The Red Chrome Legion was founded as a posergang by a group of teenagers who cosplayed as Nazis. Like other posergangs before them, they soon became what they pretended to be. The neo-fascist ideology grew to become the gang's true identity, with skinhead members uniting around hate group ideology.

They spent their time terrorizing anyone they thought wasn't "right" - anyone different from themselves. All members wore uniforms, with flags and militaristic slogans becoming their rule. They enhanced their bodies with so much cyberware that they were soon considered just another boostergang in Night City.

Around 2020, the Legion could mainly be found in the South City and Studio City districts.

### Time of the Red (2030s-2040s)

During the Time of the Red, the Legion was an active group within the Combat Zones of Night City. They continued their activities, fighting against other gangs for territory. Over the years, they began talking about "The Great Caesar," an almost messianic figure who would supposedly rise from their ranks to conquer Night City and establish a "new American Empire free of the pollution of foreign filth and corrupt culture."

### The Iron Sights War (Mid-2040s)

By the mid-2040s, the Red Chrome Legion and the Iron Sights gang had renewed their conflict due to the Red Chromers' habit of poaching young Iron Sight recruits. The Legion attacked a convoy from the Iron Sights' new benefactors, stealing hardware. This led to a full-scale war within the combat zone that required MAX-TAC intervention.

The Legion later hijacked the Militech Hammerhead cargo train to move their stolen equipment. After a series of failures against the Iron Sights, the gang's leader was killed in a bloody coup orchestrated by Vox and Populi, two young recruiters.

### 2045

By 2045, the Legion had undergone a transformation under new leadership. Vox and Populi recruited heavily from homeless encampments, dramatically increasing their numbers. The gang changed their look, with members wearing red and black uniforms with helmets and masks. While still described as heavily chromed-up, jackbooted neo-nazis, they became more patient and organized, awaiting orders rather than thinking for themselves.

## Organization Structure

### Leadership
- **Vox** - One of two leaders who took over after the 2045 coup
- **Populi** - Co-leader with Vox
- **Maniple** - Former leader killed in 2045 coup

### Philosophy
The Red Chrome Legion believes in a "new American Empire" free of "foreign filth and corrupt culture." They recruit the desperate and marginalized, offering food and shelter in exchange for oaths signed in blood. Their ideology has evolved from mere gang aesthetics into true believer radicalization.
