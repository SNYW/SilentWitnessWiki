# Team Monster

**Type:** Edgerunner Mercenary Crew  
**Territory:** Various (hangs out at Forlorn Hope)  
**Threat Level:** High (Elite Edgerunners)  

## Overview

Team Monster is a fiercely loyal mercenary crew operating in Night City during the Time of the Red (2040s). They represent the modern, high-end edgerunner crew—professionals hand-selected for their individual strengths by a mysterious fixer known as Turbo (Mr. Fixit).

## History

### Formation

The members of Team Monster were hand-selected for their individual strengths by fixer Turbo. The team has been in a working partnership for approximately a year, building a reputation as one of the most capable crews in Night City.

### The Anne Boleyn Heist

Team Monster became the subject of much rumor after the infamous Anne Boleyn heist. Anne Boleyn was a supermax container ship carrying a major payday's worth of Arasaka milspec gear. The crew successfully:
- Destroyed a fleet of security drones
- Defeated an "insane AI" aboard the ship
- Made off with significant milspec equipment

This job cemented their reputation as elite edgerunners.

### Biotechnica Animal Recovery

Recently, Team Monster helped recover a slew of stolen animal test subjects for Biotechnica. What originated as genetic experiments to enhance and repopulate an ecosystem resulted in a heist to supply rare pets to the highest bidder on the black market.

The team followed a hot lead to an upscale residential high rise. One of the animals multiplied into hundreds of flesh-eating killer bunnies. Despite the chaos, they managed to return one lone blood-thirsty critter to Biotechnica.

### Hangout: Forlorn Hope

Team Monster is known to frequent the Forlorn Hope, a bar in the Reclamation Zone. This establishes their connection to that area of Night City.
