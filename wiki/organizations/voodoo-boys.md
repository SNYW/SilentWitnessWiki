# Voodoo Boys

**Type:** Netrunner Gang / Boostergang  
**Territory:** Pacifica (RED Era)  
**Threat Rating:** High

## Overview

The Voodoo Boys are an enigmatic netrunner gang operating out of Pacifica during the Time of the Red. Despite their name—which was given to them by outsiders who confused their practices with an earlier twenty-first century gang—their beliefs are anything but a pose. The Voodoo Boys take their voodoo religion deadly serious, making them one of the most mysterious and dangerous gangs in Night City.

## History

### Origins (2062)

The Voodoo Boys trace their origins to 2062, when climate change devastated Haiti, wiping the nation off the face of the earth. Many Haitian refugees fled to Night City, where they found work on the ambitious (but ultimately failed) construction project to turn Pacifica into a resort city. When the project collapsed, the Haitian refugees remained in Pacifica, forming a tight-knit community.

Local Night City residents began calling these Haitians the "Voodoo Boys," drawing superficial comparisons to a defunct gang from the early 2000s. However, unlike the original gang—which used "voodoo" as nothing more than an aesthetic—the Haitian refugees brought their genuine spiritual practices with them.

### Time of the Red Era

During the Time of the Red, the Voodoo Boys became the self-appointed guardians of the Haitian refugee community in Pacifica. They protect their people from the violence and chaos that engulf the district, earning respect from the local population.

The gang also began probing the Blackwall, the massive firewall protecting the world's net infrastructure from rogue AIs. Their goal: to make contact with these rogue AIs beyond the barrier, seeking knowledge and power that could transform Night City—and possibly the world.

## Organization Structure

### Philosophy

The Voodoo Boys are deeply religious, practicing a syncretic blend of Haitian Vodou that they've adapted to the technological world of Night City. They believe that the spirits (lwa) can communicate through the net, and that the Blackwall is a spiritual barrier separating the living world from the realm of the ancestors.

### Membership

Most Voodoo Boys are netrunners, using their technical skills both for the gang's operations and their spiritual pursuits. They maintain a secretive and exclusive membership, distrustful of outsiders. The gang is predominantly Haitian, though some outsiders have been accepted over time.

### Leadership

- **Brigitte** - The spiritual and operational leader of the Voodoo Boys
- **Placide** - Brigitte's second-in-command

## Territory

The Voodoo Boys operate primarily in:
- Pacifica (Central and Southern areas)
- The Old Combat Zone (occasional operations)

## Operations

### Netrunning Activities

The Voodoo Boys specialize in netrunning, using custom viruses and neural implants to probe the Blackwall. They develop viruses capable of freezing neural networks and are constantly seeking to push deeper into the digital realm beyond the firewall.

### Community Protection

The gang serves as protectors of the Haitian community in Pacifica, providing security and dispute resolution for refugees who have nowhere else to turn.

### Blackwall Probing

Their primary obsession is the Blackwall. The Voodoo Boys believe that beyond the Blackwall lies not only rogue AIs, but the spirits of the ancestors and immense technological power. This quest drives much of their activity.
