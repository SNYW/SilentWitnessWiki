## Overview

The Dirty Hippies are a unique group of guerrilla-gardening reclaimers who operate in Night City during the Time of the Red. Many members are nomads who possess expertise in efficient gardening setups. Despite their name, they are not a poser gang—they simply couldn't shake the moniker they were given.

## History

### Origins

The Dirty Hippies emerged during the chaos of the Fourth Corporate War and the subsequent Time of the Red. As Night City fell into ruin and infrastructure collapsed, groups of environmental activists and nomads began organizing to reclaim abandoned urban spaces for agriculture.

### RED Era Activities (2040s)

During the 2040s, the Dirty Hippies were based out of Rancho Coronado in Night City. They established hidden gardens in abandoned lots and rooftops, using their nomad connections to acquire supplies and distribute their products.

Around 2045, the Dirty Hippies suffered a significant setback when they were raided by a mercenary crew. The firefight resulted in several member casualties and the destruction of garden beds. Similar conflicts had plagued other guerrilla gardens across Night City, with rumors suggesting Continental Brands was behind the attacks.

## Activities

### Agriculture and Products

The Dirty Hippies primarily cultivate herbs and drugs, collectively known as "ganga." Their main crop is cannabis, which they grow in hidden gardens throughout Rancho Coronado. While most of their harvest is for internal use within the community, a percentage finds its way to Night Markets across the city. Surplus products are shipped out via nomad convoys in exchange for money and supplies.

### Construction and Engineering

Beyond farming, the Dirty Hippies possess valuable skills in building efficient solar and aquaponic systems. They constantly seek volunteers (sweat equity) and financial backers to help transform blighted areas into more livable spaces. These skills make them valuable allies in the resource-starved environment of the Time of the Red.

## Structure and Philosophy

The Dirty Hippies operate on a commune-based model with a loose, decentralized structure. Members who disagree with a local cell's decisions often simply move to join another group, leading to a steady circulation of knowledge and talent throughout the organization.

However, this structure also gives the group a cultish reputation. They are suspicious of outsiders and have a strong aversion to corporate entities, particularly Continental Brands, which they consider their main oppressor.

## Relationships

### With Corporations

The Dirty Hippies view corporations like Continental Brands as their primary enemies, believing these entities are responsible for environmental destruction and the collapse of proper societal structures.

### With Edgerunners

The group maintains mutual advantage arrangements with edgerunners, trading food, lodging, or ganga in exchange for firepower and protection. This provides them with security while offering solo operators valuable resources in the post-war environment.

### With Nomads

Given many members have nomad backgrounds, the group maintains strong connections with nomad families. These connections allow them to transport goods across the wasteland and acquire supplies difficult to find within Night City.
