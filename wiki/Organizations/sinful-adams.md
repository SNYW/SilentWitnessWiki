## Overview

The Sinful Adams are a unique street gang that operates in the Boneyard district of South Night City during the Time of the Red (2040s). Unlike typical boostergangs, they function more as community protectors and organizers, maintaining a surprisingly benevolent grip on their territory.

## History

### Origins

The Sinful Adams emerged during the chaos of the Fourth Corporate War when refugees began building a shanty-town on the grounds of the former Night City Garden of Rest cemetery. The gang took its name from the biblical reference, reflecting their self-perception as fallen but reformed individuals.

### RED Era Operations

By 2045, the Sinful Adams had established themselves as the de facto leaders and protectors of the Boneyard community. Their leadership includes college-educated members who have taken it upon themselves to teach local children—providing some normalcy in the post-war chaos.

## Organization

### Structure

The Sinful Adams operate more like a community organization than a typical gang:

- **Protectors**: Guard the community from outside threats
- **Educators**: Teach local children at their informal school
- **Mediators**: Resolve disputes within the community

### Code of Conduct

The gang takes grave desecration extremely seriously and will aggressively defend against any who would disrespect the dead or the community's sacred spaces. They have been known to:

- Accept unaffiliated edgerunners as temporary residents if they contribute to the community
- Provide safe haven for those seeking refuge
- Demand respect for the community's rules and boundaries

## Activities

### Community Services

- Running an informal school for neighborhood children
- Organizing annual Halloween festivals for residents
- Providing security for the Boneyard
- Managing water access (through illegal tapping of city mains)

### Economy

The Sinful Adams are involved in:
- Protecting local crop production
- Managing the community's bar, "The Crypt"
- Basic community governance

## Territory

The Sinful Adams control the Boneyard in South Night City—a shanty-town built on the grounds of a former cemetery. Their territory is known for:

- Unusually fertile soil allowing crop growth
- A peaceful atmosphere despite the surrounding chaos of South Night City
- The presence of The Crypt bar

## Relations

- **Edgerunners**: Willing to allow temporary camping for those who contribute
- **Other Gangs**: Defensive of territory; would respond aggressively to attempts at encroachment
- **Locals**: Generally appreciated as protectors and community organizers
