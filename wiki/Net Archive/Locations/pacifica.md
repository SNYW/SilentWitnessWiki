**Tags:** District, Time-of-the-Red, Combat-Zone, Pacifica, Location


**District Code:** W  
**Type:** Rebuilding Urban Zone  
**Threat Rating:** Medium

## Overview

Located in southern Night City, Pacifica (also known as the Pacifica Playground) was originally an upper-class residential area nestled between the ocean and the hills, famous for its entertainment sector which included the famous amusement park, Playland by the Sea.

During the Fourth Corporate War and the Night City Holocaust, Pacifica suffered greatly as refugees flooded the area. However, unlike neighboring suburbs, it was never as bad due to Playland by the Sea's continued operation and corporate sponsorships.

By the 2040s, Pacifica was in the midst of a massive development being built around Playland by the Sea, with ongoing projects such as the rebuilding of the NCART lines. The rebuilding process continued steadily during the RED era as investors showed interest in expanding the region.

## Notes

Pacifica stands out as one of the few RED-era districts that retained its tourist industry throughout the Time of the Red, largely due to Playland by the Sea. The presence of the amusement park brought corporate investment and jobs to the area, helping Pacifica avoid the worst fate of other Combat Zone-adjacent neighborhoods.

The Piranhas party gang was known to provide security services at Playland, while the Philharmonic Vampyres caused occasional disturbances, notably during a Halloween event where they frightened children.
