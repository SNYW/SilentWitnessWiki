## Description

Thehorn is a popular bar and edgerunner hangout located in the Watson Development district of Night City. Known for its laid-back atmosphere and surprisingly affordable drinks, Thehorn attracts a mix of working-class locals, up-and-coming mercs, and veterans looking for a quiet place to drink away from the flashier clubs in Little China.

The bar gets its name from an old piece of signage — a faded neon horn from a long-defunct music store that still glows faintly above the entrance. Regulars say it's good luck to touch the horn before ordering your first drink.

## Atmosphere

Thehorn has a worn, comfortable feel:
- Dim red lighting (a nod to the Red era atmosphere)
- Worn but clean furniture
- A mix of booth seating and bar stools
- A small stage for live music performances
- Net access available at the bar

The music tends toward classic rock and old-world jazz — sounds from before the Fourth Corporate War that have become retro-fashionable.

## Owner

- **Rosa "Mom" Chen** — A former bartender from pre-war Night City who somehow held onto the property through the war years. She's in her 60s but sharp as a tack, and runs the place with a firm but fair hand. Mom Chen knows everyone in Watson and serves as an informal information broker.

## Menu

Thehorn is known for its cheap drinks and generous portions:

**Drinks:**
- Black Cat Whiskey: 8 eb

- Net媚 cocktail: 12 eb
- Mom's Special (house drink): 10 eb
