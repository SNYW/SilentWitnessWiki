# City Medical Center

**Tags:** Time-of-the-Red, Medical-Facility


**Type:** Hospital / Medical Facility  
**Area:** Upper Marina (District B)  
**Threat Rating:** Low (Corporate Protected)

## Overview

The City Medical Center is one of Night City's premier medical facilities, surviving the devastation of the Fourth Corporate War and the fires that swept through Old Downtown. During the Time of the Red, this hospital serves as one of the last remaining facilities capable of handling major surgeries and treating the periodic plague outbreaks that ravage the city.

## History

Originally one of Night City's most modern hospitals on the West Coast by 2020, the facility was known for its extremely high prices—6,000 eurodollars per day for a semi-private room. The private rooms on the top floors were comparable to luxury hotel suites.

The hospital survived the Fourth Corporate War but suffered from lower-level flooding and regular disruptions to water, power, and communications during the post-war period. Despite these challenges, it remained one of the few facilities in the city capable of handling critical medical cases.

## RED Era Operations

In the 2040s (RED era), the City Medical Center operates as a large research hospital with multiple corporate ties. Beyond standard medical care, the facility offers—for the right price—therapy and biosculpting services. The hospital houses some of the best medical staff and technology in Night City.

Due to the overwhelmed state of medical services during the Time of the Red, many citizens have shifted to using ripperdoc clinics for routine procedures, but the City Medical Center remains the go-to location for serious injuries and specialized treatments.

## Notable Features

- **Corporate Ties:** The hospital maintains relationships with various corporations, providing exclusive medical services to corporate clients
- **Biosculpting:** For the right price, patients can access cutting-edge body modification and therapy services
- **Research Facility:** Ongoing medical research programs, particularly relevant during plague outbreaks
- **AV Landing Pads:** Helipad access for emergency transfers (still functional in RED era)

## Current Status

The City Medical Center remains operational but operates under constant strain. Water, power, and communications disruptions are common, requiring backup systems and contingency protocols. The facility is a critical resource in Night City's fragile healthcare infrastructure.
