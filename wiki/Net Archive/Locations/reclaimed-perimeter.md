**Tags:** Badlands, Time-of-the-Red


**Type:** Collection of Repopulated Settlements  
**Area:** Badlands / Night City Surroundings  
**Threat Rating:** Variable (Low to Medium)

## Overview

The Reclaimed Perimeter refers to the settlements in the vicinity of Del Coronado Bay that were repopulated during the Time of the Red (2020s-2040s). These former ghost towns were revived by refugees and nomads seeking new homes after the devastation of the Fourth Corporate War.

## History

### The Collapse and Exodus (2020s)

The Fourth Corporate War devastated Night City and its surroundings, leaving many citizens homeless. With the suburbs overpopulated, a large number of refugees began leaving the ruined metropolis in search of new homes around 2026.

Night City was a major regional hub, neighboring many smaller towns and suburbs. Most of these settlements had been abandoned during the Collapse of the 1990s-2000s, as they were too far out to be protected from roving gangs. With support from nomad populations and private security, refugees attempted to make new homes in these abandoned places.

Over the following years, reclaimers started giving new life to former ghost towns. These settlements soon became transit points for travelers including nomad families, passing corporates, and other reclaimer groups. However, these areas remained dangerous due to road gangs infesting the wastes.

### Recovery (2030s-2040s)

Nomad convoys connected all reclaimed towns with each other and the closest major hubs. This proved successful, with many new settlements appearing around Night City. People from all kinds of backgrounds began populating these areas, especially nomads who decided to settle.

By the 2040s, few of these settlements had their own police forces and had to rely on hired muscle. Groups of lawmen formed to aid unprotected towns and highways—hard-riding, fast-shooting individuals similar to the Wyatt Earps of the Old West.

## Notable Settlements

The Reclaimed Perimeter includes several repopulated locations:

- **Atascadero** — Former town revived by refugees
- **Avia Beach** — Coastal settlement reclaimed by survivors
- **Cambria** — Small community rebuilt during the RED era
- **Los Osos** — Repopulated settlement near Night City
- **Paso Robles** — Wine country town revived after the Collapse
- **Pismo Beach** — Coastal community in the Reclaimed Perimeter
- **San Luis Obispo** — Major reclaimed city in the region
- **San Simeon** — Settlement along the coastline

## Travel and Trade

The nomad convoys that connect these settlements are vital to regional trade. Travelers can move between Night City and the Reclaimed Perimeter, though armed escorts are recommended due to remaining dangers from road gangs and Raffen Shiv.

## Significance

The Reclaimed Perimeter represents the resilience of survivors in the aftermath of the Fourth Corporate War. These settlements provide an alternative to life in Night City proper, offering more space but also requiring self-reliance and defensive capability.
