## Description

The Ashcroft Hotel was once the largest, most expensive, and most exclusive hotel in Night City. Owned by the wealthy Ashcroft-Hammersmith family from England, this five-star establishment was favored by wealthy European corporates, tourists, celebrities, and notorious solos. By 2020, rooms and suites rented from 300 to 5,000 eurodollars per night, and reservations were essential.

## History

### Pre-War Era

The Ashcroft Hotel represented the ultimate expression in luxury and service in Night City. Security was provided by plainclothes operatives contracted from Dieter-Kauffman AG, one of the finest German security firms. The on-site representative of the family was Winifred Ashcroft-Hammersmith, a reclusive and eccentric woman whose daughter Julia handled much of the actual work.

### The Fourth Corporate War

During the Fourth Corporate War, the Ashcroft Hotel was vastly damaged by the Night City Holocaust of 2023. The nuclear blast left the building tilted and in ruins, soon becoming part of the radioactive Hot Zone.

### Time of the Red (2040s)

The remains of the structure remained uninhabited for years, though eventually they became the hideout of an infamous Maelstrom gang member known as Ripper. He maintained a notorious presence in the Hot Zone by using large groups of "diggers" — scavengers forced to search for lost tech among the radioactive ruins.

Ripper converted the Ashcroft into his base of operations, occupying much of the west wing's 6th floor, while his guards occupied the upper levels of the east wing. The lower areas housed his diggers. All ground accesses were blocked by metal shafts and rubble, with the only entrance being a makeshift walkway that reached the seventh floor of the east wing.

In 2045, a group of mercenaries hired by the owners of the Forlorn Hope successfully assaulted the hotel and eliminated Ripper, freeing his captive ripperdoc assistant and recovering valuable information about his dealings with Rocklin Augmentics.
