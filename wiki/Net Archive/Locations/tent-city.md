# Tent City

**District:** Hot Zone (The Island)
**Threat Rating:** Combat (Highest)

## Overview

Tent City is a sprawling makeshift encampment within the Hot Zone, the devastated heart of Night City that was destroyed during the nuclear blast of 2023. During the Time of the Red, this area represents the worst of what the city has to offer — ruins, radiation, and death.

## Description

The encampment consists of thousands of improvised shelters made from salvaged materials, canvas, and whatever else survivors could find. It's home to the most desperate souls in Night City — scavvers, radiation addicts, and those with nowhere else to go.

The Night City Health Department warns that the Hot Zone is not safe for unprotected occupation or travel. Those entering must be properly equipped with radiation protection.

## Notable Features

- **Radiation Hazard:** The area still contains significant radiation from the 2023 nuclear blast
- **Scavver Activity:** Numerous groups of scavvers operate in the area, salvaging valuable tech from the wreckage
- **Black Market:** Radioactive precious metals (gold contaminated during the blast) occasionally appear on the black market

## Organizations

- Various scavver groups
- Occasionally Maelstrom gangers
- Reckoners
