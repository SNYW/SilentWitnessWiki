## Overview

Forlorn Hope is a notorious bar and edgerunner hangout located in the Woodland Park neighborhood of North Heywood. Originally established in the 2020s, the bar was destroyed in 2045 but was rebuilt later that same year by owners Marianne and John "The Professor" Freeman.

## History

### The Original Forlorn Hope

The original Forlorn Hope was a well-known establishment in Night City's bar scene, popular with solos and edgerunners. In 2045, it was destroyed by Maelstrom gangers led by a Maelstromer known as Ripper, who forced squatters to carry explosives into the building.

### Rebirth (2045)

After the destruction, owners Marianne and John Freeman wanted to rebuild. With the help of their friend Jack Skorkowsky, a real estate agent, they found a new location in Woodland Park, North Heywood. The building had previously housed a mahjong parlor that went out of business in 2041.

The new Forlorn Hope was completely renovated and opened in 2045. However, opening night was marked by a massive attack by the Red Chrome Legion, who launched a coordinated assault from three vantage points: the basement, ground floor, and roof. Despite being outnumbered nearly two-to-one, the bar's patrons and staff successfully defended the establishment, decimating the Red Chrome Legion forces.

### Reputation

After its dramatic opening night, Forlorn Hope gained a reputation as one of the toughest bars in Night City. The establishment positioned itself to compete directly with the Afterlife for street merc business.
