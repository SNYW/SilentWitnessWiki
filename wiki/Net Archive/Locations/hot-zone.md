## Locations

### (D1) The Ashcroft Hotel
Once the most luxurious hotel in Night City. Now the center of Maelstrom's Hot Zone scavenging operations.

### (D2) The N54
The former home of Network 54 in Night City. The tallest structure still standing in the Hot Zone – climbing it and tagging the top has become a tradition among urbanauts.

### (D3) Toggle's Temple
An underground firearms range and obstacle course run by a conspiracy theorist named Toggle.

### (D4) Totentanz
A chrome metal club and home base for Maelstrom.

## Notes

The Hot Zone is the heart of Night City — but it's been dead since the Fourth Corporate War. The nuke destroyed the original Corporate Center, Bank Block, and City Center. Only ruins remain.

Maelstrom controls much of the scavenging operations here. Enter at your own risk.
