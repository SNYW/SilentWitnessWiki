# The Randy Dandy

**Tags:** Bar, Threat-Medium

**Type:** Mobile Bar / Passenger Ferry  
**Location:** Flotsam, Del Coronado Bay (off the coast of Night City)

## Overview

The Randy Dandy is a passenger ferry converted into a mobile bar, owned by a sea nomad known simply as "the Skipper." The vessel is usually moored in Flotsam, a drift town floating in Night City harbor that can only be accessed by boat—or for the truly daring, by swimming.

The bar serves as a hub for harbor gossip and a marketplace for salvage before it reaches middlemen in Night City. The Skipper maintains strict house rules: "don't start none, won't be none." Disobedient customers find themselves tossed overboard by her burly crew.

## History

Around 2035, a young girl named Xiaolajiao was abandoned in Flotsam by a people-smuggler. The Randy Dandy's crew took pity on her, letting her wipe glasses and tables for her keep. The Skipper eventually semi-adopted her as a surrogate sibling, and she now works as a server at the bar.

The Randy Dandy occasionally leaves Flotsam to pick up important dignitaries when the bar is booked for nomad family meetings.

## Atmosphere

The Randy Dandy has a working-class maritime atmosphere, attracting sea nomads, salvage dealers, and those seeking harbor gossip. The Skipper ensures the eddies keep flowing and business remains the general atmosphere.

## Signature Drinks

### The Blackbeard
The Randy Dandy's signature drink during the 2040s, costing 20 eb per shot. It's a mixture of rum, ginger oil, and a squeeze of lime on the rocks.

## Notable Staff
