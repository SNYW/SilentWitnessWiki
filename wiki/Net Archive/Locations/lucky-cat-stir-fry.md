## Overview

Lucky Cat Stir Fry is a beloved budget restaurant in New Westbrook that has earned a reputation for serving authentic, affordable Asian cuisine in a city where decent food at reasonable prices is hard to find. The restaurant has become a staple for locals, edgerunners, and anyone looking for a satisfying meal without breaking the bank.

## History

### Origins

Lucky Cat Stir Fry was founded in the early 2040s by a family of Chinese immigrants who originally operated a small food stall in the Night City Food Park. After saving enough money, they upgraded to a proper restaurant location in New Westbrook, where they could serve their traditional stir fry recipes to a wider audience.

### Time of the Red

During the chaotic aftermath of the Fourth Corporate War, Lucky Cat survived by adapting to the limited ingredients available in Night City. Rather than using expensive imported proteins, the restaurant developed creative recipes using locally-sourced tofu, noodles, and vegetables. This innovation not only kept prices low but also created a unique menu that distinguishes Lucky Cat from more pretentious establishments.

## Atmosphere

The restaurant features:
- Simple, clean decor with traditional Chinese lanterns and cat motifs
- Open kitchen where patrons can watch their food being prepared
- Comfortable seating for about 30 guests
- Background music playing classic Cantonese pop and modern beats
- Friendly staff who remember regular customers by name

## Menu

Lucky Cat's menu focuses on classic stir fry dishes made with readily available ingredients:

- **Katsu Noodle Bowl** — crispy pork cutlet over egg noodles with teriyaki sauce (€8)
- **Teriyaki Tofu Sushi** — tofu sushi rolls with avocado and cucumber (€6)
- **Fried Rice Plate** — classic fried rice with vegetables and your choice of protein (€7)
- **General Tso's Tofu** — crispy tofu in spicy sauce with steamed rice (€8)
- **Pad Thai** — rice noodles with peanuts and bean sprouts (€7)

All meals come with a small side of pickled vegetables and complimentary tea.

## Clientele
