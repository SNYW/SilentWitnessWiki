## Description

The Regional Airport is a decommissioned civilian airport located in the Badlands approximately 30 City proper kilometers from Night. Once a bustling hub for regional aviation before the Fourth Corporate War, it now serves as a makeshift landing zone for those with the credits to afford aerial transport—or the contacts to hitch a ride.

The airport's main runway is still intact, though cracked and covered in sand in places. The terminal building has been partially salvaged, with sections collapsed or burned. Despite its decrepit state, it's one of the few functional landing zones in the region for aircraft that can't make it to Night City's controlled airports.

## RED Era (2045)

By 2045, the Regional Airport operates as:
- A landing strip for cargo and passenger aircraft
- A meeting point for deals requiring air transport
- A waystation for travelers entering/exiting Night City by air

The airport is technically "neutral territory," though various groups maintain a presence:
- **Air Traffic Controllers** (unofficial): A small group that coordinates landings for a fee
- **Fuel Dealers:** Independent operators selling jet fuel and avgas
- **Security:** Bare minimum; airfield security is the responsibility of those using it

## Notable Features

- **Runway 09/27:** The main landing strip, still functional for most light to medium aircraft
- **The Terminal:** Partially standing, houses the "lounge" (a rough bar and waiting area)
- **Hangar Row:** Several abandoned hangars, some used for vehicle storage or repairs
- **Control Tower:** Damaged but occasionally used as an observation point

## Getting There

The airport can be reached via:
- Ground transport from Night City (approximately 45 minutes by ground vehicle)
- Charter aircraft from Night City
- Nomad caravan (less common)

Due to its distance from the city and the dangerous nature of the surrounding Badlands, ground travel is risky without armed escort.

## Notes

The Regional Airport is referenced in Cyberpunk RED materials as a key transport hub outside Night City's main infrastructure, serving as a lifeline for those who need to move goods or people without corporate oversight.
