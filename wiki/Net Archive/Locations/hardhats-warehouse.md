# Hardhat's Warehouse

**District:** Hot Zone - Old City Center (The Island)
**Threat Rating:** Combat (Highest)

## Overview

Hardhat's Warehouse is a derelict industrial building located in the Old City Center section of the Hot Zone. During the Time of the Red, this area remains one of the most dangerous in Night City, filled with the ruins of pre-war corporate skyscrapers.

## Description

The warehouse gets its name from the hardhat symbol painted on its exterior — a relic from the construction crews who once worked here. Now it serves as a temporary shelter for various groups of scavvers and desperate survivors.

The building itself is in poor condition — portions of the roof have collapsed, and the interior is filled with debris. However, its location in the Hot Zone means that anything of value inside is potentially worth the risk of entering.

## Notable Features

- **Salvage Operations:** Scavvers frequently use the warehouse as a base for operations in the surrounding Hot Zone
- **Meeting Point:** The location is sometimes used as neutral ground for shady deals
- **Dangerous Interior:** Unstable floors and remaining radiation make exploration extremely hazardous

## Organizations

- Various scavver groups
- Occasional gangers from Maelstrom
