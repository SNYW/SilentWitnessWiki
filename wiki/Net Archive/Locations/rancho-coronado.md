# Rancho Coronado

**Tags:** Pacifica, District, Location, Combat-Zone


**District Code:** X  
**Type:** Combat Zone  
**Threat Rating:** Very High

## Overview

Technically part of Night City, no one has yet bothered to pony up the cash to buy Rancho Coronado's seat on the City Council. As a result, the district lacks in just about every resource, from utilities to fire and police services.

## Government

- **City Manager:** None
- **Security Provider:** NCPD (in theory)
- **Gangs Present:** 6th Street, Albino Alligators, Dirty Hippies, Steel Vaqueros, Voodoo Boys

## Locations

### (X1) Albino Alligator Carwash
Home base for the Albino Alligators. Also one of the most reliable places to find clean drinking water in the district.

### (X2) Coronado Heights
An apartment building so close to Pacifica that it might as well be part of it.

### (X3) Eagle Rock Stadium
A former football field transformed into a cargo container community.

### (X4) Jack 'N' the Green
A guerilla gardening outfit run by reclaimers.

### (X5) Minimallism
Once a mall catering to eager beaverville consumers, now an empty husk claimed on one side by reclaimers and on the other by a consortium of Fixers who take turns running Night Markets there. Also known as the RC Night Market by residents.

## Notes

Rancho Coronado is essentially abandoned by Night City. No city manager, no real services. The gangs and reclaimers basically run the place.
