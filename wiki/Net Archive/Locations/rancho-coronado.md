**District Code:** I (formerly)  
**Type:** Overpacked Suburb  
**Threat Rating:** High

## Overview

Rancho Coronado is a struggling suburban district located south of central Night City during the Time of the Red. Originally developed in the late 20th century as a middle-class residential area for Night City workers, it became one of the most heavily impacted neighborhoods in the postwar era.

By the 2040s, Rancho Coronado had transformed into an overpacked suburb plagued by poverty, crime, and neglect. The once-clean suburban streets were now crowded with refugee camps and tent cities, while industrial zones grew from the ruins of abandoned mini-malls. The district lacks basic utilities including reliable fire and police services.

## History

### Post-War Decline
After the Fourth Corporate War, refugees from around the metropolitan area flooded into the surrounding suburbs, constructing tent cities in what had previously been safe suburban neighborhoods. Many local residents were pushed out due to ongoing gentrification in the Rebuilding Urban Center, further compounding the district's problems.

By 2045, Rancho Coronado had not seen any major development. While the rest of Night City's districts were gaining city managers, nobody on the Night City Council was interested in representing this struggling area. The district became known as one of the places the city had essentially abandoned.

## Government

## Notes

Rancho Coronado represents the forgotten side of Night City's recovery during the Time of the Red. While other districts received investment and development, this area was left to decay. The struggle for clean basic water and services defines daily life here. Despite the harsh conditions, some residents have formed communities and support networks, including the Rancho Coronado Roosters roller derby team made up of tent city residents.

The district serves as a stark reminder that not everyone in Night City benefited from the city's reconstruction efforts.
