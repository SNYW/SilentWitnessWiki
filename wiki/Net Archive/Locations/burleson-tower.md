**Era:** Time of the Red (2040s)

## Description

Burleson Tower is a ruined former hotel located in what was once central Night City. Originally built by the Burleson Construction Company, the building was taken over by the Skiv Family mob in the early 2000s and converted into a hotel. By 2020, it had deteriorated significantly but remained popular due to its convenient location near the City Center, Corporate Center, and financial district.

## History

### Pre-War Era

The Burleson Construction Company was responsible for many infrastructure projects in Central Night City, though they went bankrupt after the Skiv Family mob took over their businesses in the early 2000s. The mob left the building standing and renamed nothing as a monument to their victory, then opened it as a hotel.

By 2020, the one-star hotel had high rates due to its convenient location. The top three floors housed Totentanz, a poorly-supervised club frequented by boostergang members. A two-story building east of the tower served as the home of the Sacred Blades gang.

### The Fourth Corporate War

After the Night City Holocaust of 2023, Burleson Tower became part of the Hot Zone. Badly damaged but still standing, the building was soon abandoned—until Maelstrom arrived.

### Time of the Red (2040s)

Maelstrom, having lost their entire territory to fires after the nuclear blast, made their way to Burleson Tower. They found the Warrior Heart gang already sheltering there, and a battle ensued. Maelstrom's leader Crusher killed the Warrior Heart leader, and Maelstrom established the middle floors as their new base.

The main meeting place was an old ballroom where one entire wall was covered in fire-scarred cyberware from gang members who died in the fires—including the chromed-out corpse of their original leader, Hammer. Wearing old visible-scarred chrome was considered an honor.

By 2045, Maelstrom had repaired parts of the tower and reopened Totentanz. The building served as:
- Headquarters for Maelstrom's drug network operations
- Storage for equipment and cyberware dug up from the Hot Zone
- Housing for their cyberpsycho pet, "the Pit," kept in the subbasement
- Vehicle storage in the underground parking lot

The building was in poor condition by 2045, and Maelstrom leader Warlock was searching for a new permanent home for the gang.
