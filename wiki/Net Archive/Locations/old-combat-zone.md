# Old Combat Zone

**Tags:** District, Location, Combat-Zone


**District Code:** L  
**Type:** Combat Zone  
**Threat Rating:** Extreme

## Overview

In the late 2010s and early 2020s, Night City began expanding the Island by filling in land to the southeast. In the aftermath of the 4th Corporate War, what was intended to be a shining beacon of industrial might devolved into the worst combat zone Night City had ever seen. Slowly, inch by inch, groups of edgerunners have strived to rebuild it.

## Government

- **City Manager:** Brick Coleman (as leader of Edgerunners Inc)
- **Security Provider:** Edgerunners Inc
- **Gangs Present:** Edgerunners Inc, The Faded, Generation Red, Iron Sights, The Shroomers

## Locations

### (L1) From the Ashes
A sliding scale clinic run by Phoenix Redwyne.

### (L2) Jesse James' Kosher Deli
More of a saloon than a deli, though for a small fortune you can get a pretty good corned beef on rye.

### (L3) NC Ionic Semiconductor Building
A factory-turned-cargo community. Many Iron Sights stash family members here for safety.

### (L4) The Underground
The home of the Shroomers, located deep beneath the streets of Night City.

## Notes

The Old Combat Zone is the worst of the worst — an expansion project that failed after the Fourth Corporate War. Edgerunners Inc is trying to rebuild it and reconnect it to Night City proper.
