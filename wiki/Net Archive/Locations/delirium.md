## Description

Delirium is a three-story virtuality club located in the Downtown district of central Night City during the Time of the Red (circa 2045). The club is known for its unique blend of alternate lifestyle culture and cutting-edge virtual reality technology.

## Notable Features

### Virtual Reality Experience
The main attraction of Delirium is its innovative use of Dee Vee headsets that project artificial overlays within the club. Without the headset, the club exudes a 20th-century industrial vibe. With the headsets on, users can choose their own avatar and select their preferred world, including:
- Horrorpunk
- Dark Cabaret
- Synthpunk
- Skatepunk
- Deathpunk

### Layout
- **First Floor:** Main dance floor and bar area
- **Second Floor:** Small stage for live acts, surrounded by ballet-style bars
- **Third Floor:** VIP area and staff quarters, split into three rooms: a security room, a lounge, and the club owner Magnus Haggard's apartment

## Atmosphere

As an alternate lifestyle club, Delirium plays host to every kind of goth and punk. The combination of industrial aesthetics with customizable virtual reality experiences makes it a unique destination in Night City's nightlife scene during the RED era.

## History

In 2045, the body of a wealthy CEO's son (Roman Deckard) was discovered drained of blood in the club, adding to its somewhat dark reputation.
