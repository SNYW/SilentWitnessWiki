## Overview

Home of the Estero Bay Military COG (a mixture of various military units into a single organized group). In theory, the COG is loyal to NorCal and the Pacifica Confederation, but they've also made a deal with Militech, trading land and access for training and munitions.

## Government

- **City Manager:** General Ash Giovanni (base commander)

## Locations

### (M1) Militech Corporate Operatives Housing
Secure housing for Militech employees.

### (M2) Militech Offices
Night City headquarters for Militech, a one-stop shop for all your military and security needs.

## Notes

The military base is an island of order in the chaos. The Culper Ring is a secret sect within the COG dedicated to reuniting NorCal with the US.
