# The Shark

**Type:** Apartment Complex  
**Area:** Woodland Park, North Heywood, Heywood  
**Threat Rating:** Low to Medium

## Overview

The Shark is a five-story apartment complex located in Woodland Park, in the Heywood suburb of Night City. By 2045, it was the oldest still-standing building in the neighborhood, known for its distinctive rooftop neon sign depicting a shark wearing a trilby hat.

## History

### Construction and Early Years

The Shark was constructed during the 2010s, featuring a prominent rooftop neon sign whose original advertising purpose was long forgotten by the Time of the Red. According to local legend, when someone attempted to unplug the massive sign years ago, it blew the circuits of half the apartments in the building. After that incident, it was simply left running.

The building was acquired by local fixer Billy Flight, who handled rent collection, maintained the building's functionality, and quietly ensured it stayed out of trouble.

### The Pearce Family Incident (2045)

In 2045, the top floor of The Shark was completely rented by the Pearces, a guerrilla gardening collective who grew crops on the rooftop. Their successful small business caught the attention of Continental Brands, which was planning to open an Oasis store in the neighborhood.

Frustrated by the competition, Continental Brands hired a mercenary group called the Lucky Charms to "economically realign" the Pearce's garden. The mercs headed straight to The Shark, expecting an easy job, but were kicked out by the heavily armed family of gardeners. After a standoff that involved hostage-taking, the situation was resolved when Billy Flight hired mercs to free the hostages.
