## Locations

### (I1) The Boneyard
Formerly the Night City Garden of Rest. Now a shanty town and home to the Sinful Adams. They run an annual festival on Halloween for the district's residents.

### (I2) MindNutz Lover
The hottest braindance club in South Night City.

### (I3) Savage Docs
A multi-ripperdoc operation of good reputation protected by both the Yakuza and the Tyger Claws (despite their differences).

### (I4) Silverhand Studios
Apartments and studio space rented out to artists and musicians. Run by the cousin of legendary Rockerboy Kerry Eurodyne.

### (I5) The Slammer
A ganger bar. Home of the Arena, a no-holds-barred combat ring gangers can step into to settle their disputes without murder.

### (I6) South Cargo Village
A cargo container community. Despite being on the border of The Glen, it is still in a combat zone, and the cops treat it as such.

### (I7) Union Chapel Building
Once an architectural landmark. Now abandoned, in theory. Some think the Reckoners use the basement as a refuge.

### (I8) University Cargo Bay
Cargo container housing for university students.
