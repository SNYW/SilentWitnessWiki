## Description

Laguna Bend is a dried-up reservoir settlement in the Badlands outside Night City. During the Time of the Red, this location became a significant refugee camp for survivors of the Fourth Corporate War.

The area was once known for its scenic lake, but climate change and water shortages during the 2030s-2040s turned it into a dusty depression. Despite its harsh conditions, Laguna Bend became a waystation for nomads, refugees, and travelers moving between Night City and the deeper Badlands.

## RED Era (2045)

By 2045, Laguna Bend serves as:
- A waystation for nomad caravans
- A trading post for basic supplies
- A neutral ground for different nomad clans

The settlement is largely constructed from repurposed shipping containers, abandoned vehicles, and whatever materials refugees could salvage. Despite its rough appearance, it offers a rare sense of community in the lawless Badlands.
