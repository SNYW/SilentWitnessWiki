## Overview

The University District is a rebuilding urban district located in central Night City during the Time of the Red. It contains the only still-functioning college institution in the metropolis—Night City University.

## History

### Pre-War Era (2020s-2030s)

Prior to the Fourth Corporate War, University District was located in the southwestern area of central Night City, though the new district also incorporated portions of neighboring West Hill. Originally, the old district was primarily set aside as a comfortable living space, with architecture ranging from faux brownstones to pseudo-Victorian gingerbread homes, interspersed with plenty of small shops, restaurants, and businesses within easy walking distance.

It was home to the notorious Night City University and Lake Park. Due to the close proximity of the City & Corporate District, some parts of the district were heavily damaged during the Night City Holocaust.

### Post-War Rebuilding

After the war, during the rebuilding period of Night City, the slim University District was fortified due to being on the edge of the South Night City Combat Zone. By the 2040s, rebuilding was going forward, and ongoing development projects were still arranged, which included megabuildings to house the displaced population and plans to rebuild the NCART lines above ground.
