## Overview

Chrome Cross Bar is a notorious dive bar and gang headquarters located in Little China, Watson. During the RED era (around 2045), it served as the primary meeting point and stronghold for the Red Chrome Legion, a violent neo-fascist boostergang that controlled portions of the Combat Zone in Little China.

## History

### RED Era (2045)

The Chrome Cross Bar was established as a Red Chrome Legion stronghold in Little China during the Time of the Red. The bar served as the gang's territorial anchor in the southern part of Little China, acting as both a recruiting ground and a defensive position against rival gangs.

In 2045, the bar was the site of celebrations when the Red Chrome Legion commemorated the destruction of the Forlorn Hope in North Heywood. Legionnaires gathered to mark the fall of their rival establishment, though their celebration was short-lived as mercenary forces protected the Forlorn Hope survivors.

### Territory Control

The bar was situated in the southern reaches of Little China, which the Red Chrome Legion controlled during the mid-2040s. This location allowed the gang to maintain their presence in the Combat Zone while engaging in ongoing territorial conflicts with rival groups, particularly the Iron Sights gang.

## Notable Features

## Notes

The Chrome Cross Bar represents the dark underbelly of Little China during the Time of the Red. Controlled by the Red Chrome Legion, it stood as a symbol of the gang's grip on Combat Zone territory before their eventual defeat and expulsion from the area by the Iron Sights.
