## Overview

Chopper's is a grimy dive bar located in the Upper Marina district, situated in what was formerly a butcher's shop. The establishment has maintained its original meat grinder, now repurposed as a dark joke among the regulars—it's said to still work if you need to get rid of a body.

## Atmosphere

The bar maintains a rough, no-nonsense atmosphere popular with:
- Local fixers and small-time operators
- Dock workers from the nearby marinas
- Solos looking for low-profile watering holes

## RED Era Status

Chopper's appears in the *Cyberpunk RED* Core Rulebook as a location in Upper Marina during the 2045 era. The bar represents the type of working-class establishments that thrived during the Time of the Red—practical, inexpensive, and unwelcoming to corporate types.

## Notable Features

- **The Grinder:** The old butcher's meat grinder remains behind the bar, a reminder of the building's past and a popular topic of dark humor
- **Cash-only:** No credit chips accepted—proprietor prefers eddies or barter
- **No questions:** The bar has a strict policy of not asking questions about client business

## Connections

Chopper's is located near other Upper Marina establishments and is within territory controlled by Maelstrom, though the gang doesn't actively police the area.
