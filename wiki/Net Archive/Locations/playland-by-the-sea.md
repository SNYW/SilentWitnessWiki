## Overview

Playland by the Sea is an amusement park located in the Pacifica district of southern Night City. During the Time of the Red (2040s), it was considered Night City's premiere tourist destination, surviving even as the surrounding Pacifica neighborhood struggled with decay and gang activity.

## History

### Origins (2000s-2020s)

Originally a run-down amusement park on the edge of the Pacific Ocean, Playland was purchased in 2007 by Tower of Dark, an investment cartel from Southern California that hoped to build a new park using the latest in braindance and interface technology.

By 2020, the renovated park had grown from its humble beginnings to become a major Northern Californian tourist destination—a state-of-the-art amusement center featuring live-roleplaying adventures, group braindance entertainments, parks, exhibits, and the most amazing carnival rides that early 21st century technology could offer. At night, the park's bright lights illuminated the night sky. During this time, the park was secured by automated security systems from Protective Lightning.

### RED Era (2040s)

By the 2040s, Playland by the Sea was in the midst of a massive renovation effort. The park was a popular vacation destination featuring braindance adventures, themed park rides, Continental Brands food courts, and was protected by substantial corporate security. Despite the struggles of the surrounding Pacifica district, Playland was considered Night City's premiere tourist destination at the time, being sponsored by a variety of corporations.

Due to the influence Playland had over the rest of Pacifica, the park's management was able to appoint Elliot Kane as the local city manager.

### Notable Events

During a Halloween event at the park, the Philharmonic Vampyres gang crashed the party and scared a group of children. Park security was unable to violently remove them due to the children's presence, and during the chaos, the Vampyres tore off pieces of the children's costumes while giving them candy in a strange form of compensation. Although no one was harmed, several parents were about to violently retaliate before the Vampyres halted as though signaled and left the area en masse.

## Operations

### Employment

During the mid-2040s, Playland was home to a surprising number of yogangs (young gangs), who were often used by the park as free labor. A notorious group with influence at Playland was the Piranhas party gang, whose members occasionally spent their free time there while also offering security services for payment.

### Corporate Sponsors

The park was sponsored by various corporations during the RED era, providing both security and marketing support. This corporate backing helped Playland maintain its status as a tourist destination even as the surrounding Pacifica district fell into disrepair.
