**Threat Rating:** Medium

## Overview

Playland by the Sea is Night City's premier amusement park and tourist destination, located in the Pacifica district along the southern coast. Despite the surrounding district's struggles during the Time of the Red, the park has managed to survive and even thrive thanks to corporate sponsorships and its unique offerings.

## History

### Pre-War Era (2007-2020)

Originally a run-down amusement park on the edge of the Pacific Ocean, Playland was purchased in 2007 by Tower of Dark, an investment cartel from Southern California that hoped to build a new park using the latest in braindance and interface technology.

By 2020, the renovated park had grown from its humble beginnings to become a major Northern Californian tourist destination—a state-of-the-art amusement center featuring live-roleplaying adventures, group braindance entertainments, parks, exhibits, and the most amazing carnival rides the advanced technology could offer. At night, the park's bright lights illuminated the night sky around it.

### RED Era (2040s)

By the 2040s, Playland by the Sea was in the midst of a massive renovation effort. The park was a popular vacation destination featuring braindance adventures, themed park rides, Continental Brands food courts, and was protected by substantial corporate security. Despite the struggles of the surrounding Pacifica district, Playland was considered Night City's premiere tourist destination at the time, being sponsored by a variety of corporations.

Due to the influence Playland had over the rest of Pacifica, the park's management was able to appoint Elliot Kane as the local city manager—a rare example of corporate influence over Night City's government.

During this period, the park was home to a surprising number of yogangs, who were often used by the park as free labor. A notorious group with influence at Playland were the Piranhas party gang, whose members occasionally spent their free time there while also offering security for payment.

## Notable Events

During a Halloween event at the park, the Philharmonic Vampyres gang crashed a children's party. Park security was unable to violently remove them due to the presence of children. During the chaos, the Vampyres tore pieces of children's costumes while giving them candy in a strange form of compensation. Although no one was harmed, several parents were about to violently retaliate before the Vampyres halted as though signaled and left the area en masse.
