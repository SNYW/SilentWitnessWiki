# The N54

**District:** Hot Zone - Old Corporate Center (The Island)
**Threat Rating:** Combat (Highest)

## Overview

The N54 (Network 54) Offices were once part of the thriving corporate center of Night City before the 2023 nuclear blast devastated the area. By the Time of the Red, the building lies in ruins within the Hot Zone, a haunted landscape of wrecked buildings and burned-out vehicles.

## Description

What remains of the N54 building is a skeleton of its former self — shattered windows, charred walls, and bodies still entombed in the rubble. The building was once a major media hub, home to Network 54's news and entertainment operations.

During the Time of the Red, the radiation levels have dwindled from their immediate post-blast peaks, but the area remains extremely dangerous. Only the most desperate or suicidal individuals venture into the Old Corporate Center.

## Notable Features

- **Radioactive Contamination:** The building and surrounding area are still contaminated with radiation
- **Salvage Opportunities:** Some valuable corporate tech remains in the ruins, attracting scavvers
- **Ghost Stories:** Locals whisper about ghosts of corporate employees still trapped in the wreckage

## Organizations
