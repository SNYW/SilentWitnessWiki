# Afterlife

**District:** Little China (Watson)  
**Era:** Time of the Red (2040s)

## Description

The Afterlife is Night City's most legendary edgerunner bar, renowned throughout the city for its mercenary clientele. Originally established in central Night City during the early 2010s as a former mortuary converted into a bar, the original location was abandoned due to gentrification during the reconstruction period following the Fourth Corporate War.

During the Time of the Red (circa 2045), the legendary retired solo and fixer Rogue Amendiares purchased and reopened the Afterlife in Little China, Watson. She rebuilt it in a former morgue, continuing the tradition of serving drinks named after legendary edgerunners who went out in a blaze of glory.
