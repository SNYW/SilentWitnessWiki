## Overview

Woodland Park is a neighborhood located in North Heywood, in the Heywood suburb of Night City. During the Time of the Red (2040s), it sits on the border between New Westbrook and North Heywood, on the edge with the Badlands.

Considered an "up and coming" neighborhood, by 2045 there was still much work to do to fully develop the area. Despite this, the area was pretty lively, filled with apartment complexes and an arrangement of small and big establishments. Residents gathered to have small talks, kids with skateboards trying to show off their skills, well-dressed corporates walking to work at Dynalar, or the gorgeous Muses skating around as well were a common sight. It was a relatively small neighborhood, but almost everyone knew each other.

## History

In 2045, after the destruction of the original Forlorn Hope bar in the Hot Zone, owners Marianne and John "The Professor" Freeman rebuilt the establishment in Woodland Park. They purchased a former mahjong parlor that had gone out of business in 2041 and completely renovated it. The new Forlorn Hope quickly became a notorious establishment, known for its ties to edgerunners and mercenary culture.

The opening night of the new Forlorn Hope was marked by a massive assault by the Red Chrome Legion, which was repelled by the bar's patrons and staff, becoming a legendary event in Night City history.

## Notes

The neighborhood is named after Westbrook's Woodland Boulevard from the pre-war era, referencing the Biotechnica Palm Grove that gives the area its distinctive character.
