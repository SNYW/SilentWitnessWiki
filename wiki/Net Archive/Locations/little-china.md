A struggling community attempting to crawl its way out of the combat zones and into the rebuilding urban center.

- **Security Provider:** Gold Dragons
- **Gangs Present:** Gold Dragons, Red Chrome Legion, Weng Fang Tong

## Locations

### (E1) Bridgetown
A cargo container community stacked under the end of the Pelican Boulevard overpass. It isn't uncommon for bodies to wash up on the waterfront nearby.

### (E2) Chrome Cross
A dive bar frequented by the Red Chrome Legion.

### (E3) Forlorn Hope
The home of The Forlorn Hope, a venerable edgerunner bar and Night City institution (before the events of Tales of the RED: Hope Reborn).

### (E4) Guǎngbō Tower
A symbol of Little China's aspirations for the future, this restored tower houses a number of organizations and businesses, including the Ling Po Public Library and Virtex's Virtuality Venue.

### (E5) Prosperity Gardens Tenements
A block of mixed-use apartments holding way too many people. For mysterious reasons, it is also one of the safest places to live in Little China.

## Notes

David Ling Po controls the Gold Dragons, which provide security. The district is slowly rebuilding but still struggles with its combat zone neighbors.
