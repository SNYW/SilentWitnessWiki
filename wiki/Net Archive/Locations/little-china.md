**Territory:** Combat Zone / Lawless (RED Era, 2040s)  
**Threat Rating:** Very High

## Overview

Little China was a lawless combat zone located in central Night City during the Time of the Red (2040s). Once a vibrant Asian cultural district, it fell into ruin following the Fourth Corporate War and the Night City Holocaust, becoming one of the most dangerous areas in the city.

## History

### Origins and Decline (2020s-2030s)

The area where the new Little China stood was originally divided between portions of old Little China, and large parts of the districts of Studio City and Charter Hill. During the Fourth Corporate War, this area was badly affected by the firefights and other war-related elements. After the Night City Holocaust, many residents decided to abandon their old homes, with the Asian communities moving to the more secure Watson Development to the north.

Over the following years, while other areas managed to maintain the law in some form, the southern districts of the peninsula quickly fell into despair, with gangs taking much of the power. As such, they were soon labeled as combat zones, including the whole of Little China and its neighboring districts.

### Rise of David Ling Po

A local crime lord known as David Ling Po took opportunity of this chaos by paying the new boostergangs to enforce his various dealings in the area. A notorious organization that also formed was the Little China Redevelopment Association (LCRA). Funded by various wealthy members of the Chinese community, the LCRA was hoping to revitalize the district.

### RED Era (2040s)

By the 2040s, Little China was a sprawling dangerous combat zone with many small communities fighting to stay alive and fend off the gangs. There were some well-defended locations such as the few blocks the LCRA had managed to secure in the prior years. In these places, life was almost normal.

With David Ling Po appointed as the city manager by the LCRA, by 2045 the struggling community was aiming to step out of their combat zone situation and become part of the Rebuilding Urban Center of Night City. As a symbol of this goal, Guăngbō Tower was being restored to showcase Little China's aspirations to the rest of the metropolis.

## Threat Assessment

**Threat Level: Very High**

Little China remains one of the most dangerous areas in Night City during the RED era due to:
1. Multiple rival gangs fighting for territory
2. Limited NCPD presence
3. David Ling Po's criminal operations
4. General lawlessness of combat zones
5. Occasional corporate raids

However, there are signs of hope as the LCRA works to rebuild and restore the district.

## Notes

Little China represents both the destruction War and the resilience of community efforts to rebuild during the Time of the Red. The conflict between the criminal elements (led by David Ling Po) and the legitimate community efforts (through the LCRA) creates a complex dynamic in this combat zone.
