# Megabuilding H8



**Type:** Residential Megabuilding  
**District:** Watson Development (Northside)  
**Threat Rating:** Low  
**Era:** Time of the Red (2040s)

## Description

Megabuilding H8 is one of the newer residential megabuildings in the Watson Development district, constructed during the mid-2040s as part of the Night City Co-Prosperity Sphere's (NCCS) reconstruction efforts. Like its sister building H10, H8 represents the promise of the "new Night City" — modern housing for displaced residents.

The building features modern construction with reinforced concrete and steel framing, designed to withstand the chaotic environment of post-war Night City. Each unit includes basic amenities, though residents often need to provide their own security measures.

## Layout

### Floors 1-5: Commercial/Retail
- Ground-level retail spaces
- Small eateries and fixer's stalls
- Basic medical clinic (Floor 3)

### Floors 6-40: Residential
- Individual apartment units
- Varying sizes from studio to family units
- Communal areas on select floors

### Rooftop
- Helipad (for emergency use only)
- Solar collection panels
- Communal laundry facilities

## Notable Features

- **NCCS Security Presence:** The NCCS maintains a small security checkpoint in the lobby
- **NCART Access:** Walking distance from the Watson NCART station
- **Community Feel:** Despite being a megabuilding, H8 has a stronger sense of community than most corporate housing

## Residents

Megabuilding H8 is home to a mix of:
- Working-class families
- Young professionals employed by NCCS subsidiaries
- Small-time fixers and edgerunners
- Former refugees from Old Japantown

## Location Context

Megabuilding H8 is located in the Watson Development district, one of the few areas seeing active reconstruction during the Time of the Red. Watson was originally North Oak before the war, and the NCCS rebranded it as Watson to attract Asian communities displaced from Japantown.

The area is considered relatively safe with a Low to Medium threat rating, though gang activity (particularly Tyger Claws) is known to occur on the periphery.

## In-Game Significance

Megabuilding H8 often serves as:
- A safe haven for player characters in Watson
- A location for fetch quests and delivery jobs
- A possible residence for NPCs seeking housing
