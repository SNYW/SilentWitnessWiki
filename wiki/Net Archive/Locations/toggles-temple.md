**Type:** Underground Armory & Fire Range  
**Area:** Hot Zone (beneath Old City Center)  
**Threat Rating:** High

## Overview

Toggle's Temple is a massive combination armory, gun range, and training course built into a collection of sewers, abandoned basements, and underground parking garages located beneath the western side of the wrecked Hot Zone. Its customer entrance is found inside a sewer in neighboring Little Europe, three blocks away and north from the Short Circuit.

## History

### Origin

The massive collection of guns found at Toggle's Temple were inherited by the owner, known simply as "Toggle," from his mother after she succumbed to cyberpsychosis. Rather than simply hoarding the arsenal, Toggle decided to share it with other edgerunners and gun enthusiasts, creating this unique underground facility.

### RED Era Operations

During the Time of the Red, Toggle's Temple has become a well-known destination for those seeking to test, purchase, or train with firearms in relative safety—away from the dangers of surface-level Night City.

## Access

To access the Temple, you need to either:
- Gain Toggle's personal trust
- Be vouched for by someone he trusts

The entrance is hidden within a sewer in Little Europe, making it less visible to casual observers but requiring knowledge to find.

## Facilities

The Temple offers:
- Full armory with variety of firearms
- Indoor firing ranges
- Training courses
- Test weapons with Basic Ammunition included

## Pricing

- **Entry Fee:** 20eb per person per day
- Test weapons come loaded with a full clip of Basic Ammunition
- Reloads available for purchase from Vendits
- Customers must pay for any damaged or broken firearms

## Security

Though hidden and reinforced, the Temple has minimal protection from raids since Toggle is the only one maintaining the facilities. However, many appreciative customers who use the range wouldn't take kindly to it being attacked.

## Notes

- Toggle's Temple represents the resourceful nature of RED-era entrepreneurs who find ways to profit in the post-war economy
- The location is known primarily through word-of-mouth in the edgerunner community
- The armory's origins from a cyberpsycho victim add a somber note to the enterprise
