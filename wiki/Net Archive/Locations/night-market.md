## Overview

Night Markets are a type of semi-illegal temporary market that became popular in Night City during the Time of the Red. These markets emerge sporadically when Nomads arrive with shipments of illegal merchandise, creating popup marketplaces in shipping crates and trailers.

## Description

Night Markets represent the entrepreneurial spirit of Night Citizens during the post-Holocaust reconstruction period. Unlike legitimate businesses, these markets deal in goods that fall into legal grey areas - black market items, corporate contraband, and other merchandise that can't be sold through official channels.

The markets are typically organized by powerful Fixers who coordinate with Nomad clans to bring in merchandise. Access often requires an invitation or password, making these events exclusive to those who know the right people.
