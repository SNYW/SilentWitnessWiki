# Flotsam

**Type:** Drift Town / Maritime Community  
**Location:** Port of Night City, Del Coronado Bay

## Overview

Flotsam is a drift town—a floating community of ships moored in the harbor of Night City, past a derelict container port in the South Night City District. This unique settlement consists of several larger vessels ran aground and connected by skiff-sized and smaller boats, rafts and walkways. It can only be accessed via boat (or swimming for the more daring).

By 2045, Flotsam has been in existence for at least a decade, serving as a parallel city dedicated mostly to smuggling and salvage operations. The community is controlled by sea nomads who have made this floating village their home.

## Community Life

The residents of Flotsam live in small houseboats, spending their time farming seaweed and fish for sustenance. Fresh water is produced using jackleg reverse-osmosis rigs. Those community members who prefer land-based living reside in shipping containers in the nearby derelict container port, all connected with makeshift plumbing and ladders.

The settlement has a self-sufficient, rugged quality—residents are used to dealing with the harsh realities of harbor life and the occasional storm.

## Economy

Flotsam's economy revolves around:
- **Smuggling operations** — The location provides natural cover for goods moving in and out of Night City
- **Salvage operations** — Residents scavenge from the harbor and nearby derelict structures
- **Maritime services** — Boat transport, docking, and repair services for those visiting the drift town

## Notable Features

- The floating mobile bar known as the Randy Dandy often docks at Flotsam
- Home to sea nomad families who maintain their traditional lifestyle
- Neutral ground for negotiations between various factions

## Getting There

Accessing Flotsam requires a boat. The settlement is located off the coast of Night City in Del Coronado Bay, past the derelict container port in the South Night City District. Swimming is possible but discouraged—harbor currents and hazards make it dangerous for the uninitiated.
