## Overview

Prosperity Gardens Tenements is an apartment complex located in the Little China district of central Night City. Despite having too many residents, it is mysteriously one of the safest places to live in the district.

## History

During the Time of the Red, Prosperity Gardens was known for its unusual safety relative to its population density. The complex occasionally hosts a popular day market in its premises.

While under the protection of the Gold Dragons, the market was still frequently subjected to interruptions due to gang fights, infrastructure disruption, and the occasional merc-caused explosion.

### The AV Crash Incident (2044)

On May 31, 2044, an AV crashed right into the market at Prosperity Gardens, killing a number of locals, damaging the apartment complex, and destroying the improvised market stalls. A quick response team arrived to clean up the site, with no emergency services on hand.

Lazarus was guarding the surrounding area and explained to the media that the incident was caused by a group of Iron Sights who had lost control of an AV they had stolen. A rookie reporter named Rory (Aurora O'Reilly) didn't believe this explanation and decided to investigate the truth herself.

## Present Day

The tenements continue to serve as housing for many residents of Little China. The complex remains relatively safe compared to other parts of the district, likely due to Gold Dragon protection.
