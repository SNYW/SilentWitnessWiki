# The Time Machine



**Type:** Bar & Edgerunner Hangout  
**Area:** Watson, Little China (sub-district)  
**Threat Rating:** Medium

## Overview

The Time Machine is a gritty, neon-lit bar tucked away in the back alleys of Little China, Watson. Known for its faded retro-futuristic aesthetic—complete with outdated chrome fixtures and flickering holoscreens playing old vids—the Time Machine attracts a mix of working-class locals, small-time fixers, and edgerunners looking for a quiet drink away from the more corporate-controlled establishments in the district.

## RED Era Operations

During the Time of the Red (circa 2045), The Time Machine has maintained a reputation as a place where information changes hands. The owner, a grizzled veteran known only as "Doc," has connections throughout Watson's underground economy. The bar serves cheap drinks, provides a meeting space for freelancers, and occasionally offers whisper-net access for those who need to stay connected without drawing corporate attention.

## Atmosphere

The interior is dominated by worn leather booths, a scratched counter top, and a wall of old gig posters from the 2020s—some dating back to the pre-war era. A vintage jukebox in the corner plays pre-war music, though it's been modified to accept new credits. The lighting is dim, amber-tinted, and many regulars note the constant hum of the building's aging climate systems.

## Notable Features

- **Whisper-Net Access:** Doc allows trusted patrons to use an old, shielded terminal for secure communications
- **No Questions Asked:** The bar maintains a strict policy of neutrality—gang members, corp execs, and solo edgerunners all drink here without interference
- **Information Broker:** Doc hears many things and is known to share useful tips for the right price
- **Cheap Drinks:** Despite the rough neighborhood, drinks are reasonably priced ineb

## Clientele

The Time Machine draws a diverse crowd:
- Local workers from the Northside Industrial District
- Edgerunners seeking low-profile meeting spots
- Small-time fixers and boosters
- Occasional off-duty nomads passing through

## Security

The bar has minimal physical security—Doc relies on his reputation and the understanding that causing trouble here means trouble throughout Watson's underground. Some regulars are packing, but open carry is discouraged. The building itself is old but structurally sound, with reinforced doors leading to the back rooms.

## Connections

The Time Machine has ties to:
- Local fixer networks in Watson
- Night City underground information trade
- Occasional Maelstrom contacts (strictly business)
