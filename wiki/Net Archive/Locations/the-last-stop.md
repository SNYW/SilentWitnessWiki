## History

### Origins

The Last Stop has operated for decades under various owners, surviving through the upheavals of the 2020s, the Corporate Wars, and the Holocaust of the Fourth Corporate War. It's the kind of establishment that predates the glitzy corporate culture and has managed to maintain its working-class roots throughout the changes.

### Time of the Red

During the Time of the Red, The Last Stop has become a staple for those who want a reliable, unpretentious place to drink. The bar has no interest in gang wars or corporate intrigue—it simply serves drinks and provides a safe space for patrons to unwind. Its reputation for neutrality has helped it survive when flashier establishments have come and gone.

## Atmosphere

The Last Stop features:
- Simple, functional decor with worn but clean furnishings
- A well-stocked bar with basic drinks at reasonable prices
- A jukebox playing classic rock and old-school hits
- Pool tables and a few arcade machines
- A mix of regular patrons from various backgrounds

## Clientele

The bar attracts a diverse crowd including:
- Local workers from nearby businesses
- Off-duty solos and edgerunners looking to relax
- Nomads passing through Watson
- Anyone seeking a break from Night City's chaos

## Notable Features

- **Neutral Ground:** The Last Stop maintains strict neutrality—no gang business, no corporate deals, no trouble. This policy is enforced by the owner and regular patrons.
- **Affordable Prices:** Drinks are reasonably priced, making it accessible to those who can't afford the premium prices of downtown establishments.
