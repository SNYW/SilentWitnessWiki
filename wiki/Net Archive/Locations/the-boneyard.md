## Overview

The Boneyard is a unique shanty-town community located in the South Night City district of central Night City. Formerly known as the Night City Garden of Rest before the Fourth Corporate War, this area has transformed from a peaceful cemetery into a poor but remarkably pleasant neighborhood.

## History

### Pre-War Origins

Prior to the Fourth Corporate War, this location served as the Night City Garden of Rest—a traditional cemetery. The conflict drew in many refugees who soon built a small shanty-town that came to be known as "the Boneyard."

### RED Era (2040s)

By the 2040s during the Time of the Red, the Boneyard had evolved into a poor but pleasant neighborhood. Some believed the area's oddly peaceful atmosphere was due to the unusually fertile soil from all the corpses buried there. Despite the many turmoils affecting South Night City, the Boneyard remained a relative sanctuary.

## Community

### The Sinful Adams

The Sinful Adams, a local gang, took great exception to anyone desecrating the graves that the homeless had built their tents upon. They became the protectors of the settlement and established:

- A small school for local kids (with college-educated gang members teaching)
- Protection for the community from outside threats
- Safe camping areas for unaffiliated edgerunners who could prove useful

The gang allowed unaffiliated edgerunners to camp in the Boneyard as long as they contributed to the community and protected it.

### Notable Features

- **The Crypt**: A local bar run by residents who made booze from raspberries and blackberries harvested from wild thickets
- **Fertile soil** that produced plain but varied and healthy crops
- **Water**: Illegally obtained by tapping city water mains

## Annual Events

The Sinful Adams organized a Halloween festival each year for local residents and their neighbors.

## Access

The Boneyard is accessible from South Night City. Travelers seeking refuge should approach respectfully and may be able to camp temporarily if they demonstrate willingness to contribute to the community.

## RED Era Significance

The Boneyard represents a unique example of community resilience during the Time of the Red—where even in the most unlikely places, people can come together to create something resembling normal life.
