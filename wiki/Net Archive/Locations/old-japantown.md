**Territory:** Combat Zone / Lawless (RED Era, 2040s)  
**Threat Rating:** Very High

## Overview

Old Japantown was a lawless combat zone located in central Night City during the Time of the Red (2040s). Once a vibrant Japanese cultural center, it fell into ruin following the Fourth Corporate War and the Night City Holocaust, becoming one of the most dangerous areas in the city.

## History

### Origins and Decline (2020s-2030s)

The area where Old Japantown stood was originally divided between portions of the old Japantown and Little China districts. During the Fourth Corporate War, this area was badly affected by the firefights and other war-related elements, and soon the once popular Japanese cultural center fell into chaos and despair. After the Night City Holocaust, many residents decided to abandon their old homes, with the Asian communities moving to the more secure Watson Development to the north thanks to the recently created Night City Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Over the following years, while other areas managed to maintain the law in some form, the southern districts of the peninsula quickly fell into despair, with gangs taking much of the power. As such, they were soon labeled as combat zones, including the whole of Old Japantown and its neighboring districts.

### RED Era (2040s)

By the 2040s, Old Japantown was a sprawling dangerous combat zone with very few residents other than the many gangs active in the zones. Despite this, there were some well-defended locations such as the Crisis Medical Center or the Highcourt Plaza Hotel. These areas where residents still lived were considered islands of civilization in the middle of the chaotic sea of a combat zone.

A major presence in the area were the Tyger Claws and its subgroup the Kimen-Gumi, these last providing much of the necessary security. Adrianne Casselle had also been elected as the city manager by the local family heads.

By 2045, this dying district still had a few residents attempting to hold onto their homes as gang conflicts happened all around. During this time, Maelstrom was looking to expand their operations into Old Japantown, which made them clash against the Tyger Claws.

## Threat Assessment

**Threat Level: Very High**

Old Japantown remains one of the most dangerous areas in Night City during the RED era due to:
1. Multiple rival gangs fighting for territory
2. Very few remaining civilian residents
3. Maelstrom expansion attempts creating conflict with Tyger Claws
4. Limited NCPD presence
5. General lawlessness of combat zones

The area represents the extreme contrast between the chaos of the Time of the Red and the resilience of those who still try to maintain normalcy in places like the Crisis Medical Center and Highcourt Plaza Hotel.

## Notes

Old Japantown represents the destruction of another cultural district during the Fourth Corporate War. Unlike some other areas, it saw significant population loss, with the remaining residents huddled in defended locations. The conflict between Maelstrom and Tyger Claws over this territory creates additional danger for any visitors.
