# Kasim's



**Type:** Turkish Coffeehouse and Bar  
**District:** The Glen, Heywood  
**Threat Rating:** Low  
**Era:** Time of the Red (2040s)

## Overview

Kasim's is a Turkish-style coffeehouse and bar located in the Glen district of central Night City. The establishment is notorious for its strong thimble-sized cups of Turkish-style street coffee, as well as some of the best-scented tobacco on the market, all compounded to be smoked through a nargile (hookah).

The cafe has a distinctive atmosphere that combines the smell of rose-scented tobacco with bitter cardamon-scented drinks—except there's no actual coffee beans involved.

## Owner

- **Kasymbek Kasim** — The owner, a devout Muslim of Turkish descent. He does not allow alcohol to be sold in his establishment, and the cafe is closed on Fridays for Friday prayers.

## History

Kasim's opened during the Time of the Red and quickly became a local institution. Despite its unusual policy of not serving alcohol in Night City, by the 2040s it had become notorious for its coffee, sweets, and flavored tobacco.

In 2045, a crew of mercenaries visited Kasim's seeking information, where they met the owner and several patrons, including Chevalier (a guitarist) and Destiny Hondel (a Network 54 reporter).

## Description

### Atmosphere

The interior of Kasim's smells like a combination of:
- Rose-scented tobacco
- Bitter coffee tinged with cardamom

Each thick and bitter street coffee is served in small cups, unfiltered, and flavored with cardamom. Patrons are supposed to drain the contents and leave the dregs behind.

### Menu

**Coffee:**
- Signature street coffee: 10 eb per cup (2040s)
- Premium coffee: 20 eb per cup (2045)

**Tobacco:**
- Foil packets of flavored tobacco: 20 eb (2040s), 50 eb (2045)

**Complimentary sweets:**
- Turkish delights
- Baklava

The sweets are made by Kasim's mother, Elif, who runs the kitchen. She sometimes comes out to greet favorite customers or take a puff of rose-scented tobacco. If she likes the customers, she can occasionally read their coffee grounds to tell their future.

## Notable Patrons

- **Candlemaker** — A regular patron who likes the cafe because there's no alcohol
- **Chevalier** — A guitarist who was convinced to attend Grace Steel's audition
- **Destiny Hondel** — An "on-spot" reporter for Network 54
