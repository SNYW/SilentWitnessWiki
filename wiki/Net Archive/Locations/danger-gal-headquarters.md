## Overview

The Danger Gal Headquarters serves as the global headquarters for the private investigation, bodyguard, and security corporation Danger Gal. Located in the northwestern area of Little Europe near the waterfront, the building is a distinctive thirteen-story art-deco skyscraper capped with a decorative clocktower.

## History

### Establishment

The headquarters were established during the 2030s in Little Europe, making it a fixture of the RED era. The building was chosen for its prestigious location and visibility - reflecting Danger Gal's growing reputation as one of the most elite security firms in Night City.

### 2045 Infiltration

In 2045, the headquarters was infiltrated by a group of six edgerunners who managed to reach the secured archives room. However, they encountered two Puma Squad members - Pantera and Mouse - who fought the intruders back. Only two of the edgerunners escaped, and they were later tracked down and captured.

## Building Features
