## Description

The Signboards is a notorious waystation located along the main road leading into Night City from the southern Badlands. This settlement earned its name from the countless advertising signs, corporate billboards, and weathered holo-displays that surround the area—a ghost of the pre-War commercial landscape.

During the Time of the Red, The Signboards became infamous as a dangerous neutral ground where anything can be bought or sold—from water to weapons, information to chrome. It's a place where the rules of civilization don't apply, and survival depends on who you know and what you're carrying.

## RED Era (2045)

By 2045, The Signboards has evolved into:
- A major trading hub for nomads and scavengers
- A black market center for goods of questionable origin
- A meeting point for deal-making of all kinds

The settlement is built around a large abandoned truck stop and gas station complex. Dozens of makeshift stalls, tents, and modified vehicles cluster around the original structures. At night, the faded neon signs still flicker to life, casting the area in a dim, surreal glow.
