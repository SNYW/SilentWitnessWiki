## Overview

The Crisis Medical Center is a medical facility located in Old Japantown, one of the repurposed industrial buildings that now serves as a medical clinic for the local community. During the RED era, this facility provides crucial healthcare services to residents of the densely populated neighborhood.

## History

Old Japantown was heavily damaged during the Fourth Corporate War and subsequent Time of the Red. Many of the original buildings were repurposed for new uses as the population returned and rebuilt. The Crisis Medical Center represents one of these adaptive reuse projects, converting an industrial structure into a functioning medical clinic.

## RED Era Operations

The Crisis Medical Center operates as a community health facility during the 2040s:

- **Emergency Care:** Basic emergency medical services for trauma cases
- **General Practice:** Routine medical care and checkups
- **Vaccination Programs:** Disease prevention, particularly during plague outbreaks
- **Referral Services:** Transferring critical cases to larger facilities like City Medical Center

## Notable Features

- **Adaptive Reuse:** Former industrial building converted to medical use
- **Community Focus:** Serves the local Old Japantown population
- **Limited Resources:** Strained by high patient volume and limited funding
- **Volunteer Staff:** Many staff are volunteer workers or underpaid medical professionals

## Current Status

The Crisis Medical Center remains operational but operates under constant strain. Like many medical facilities during the Time of the Red, it suffers from supply shortages, outdated equipment, and overwhelming patient loads.

## Reputation

The facility has a mixed reputation—locals appreciate the accessible care but criticize the long wait times and limited services compared to corporate medical facilities.
