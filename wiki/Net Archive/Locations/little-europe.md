## Overview

Little Europe is a rebuilding urban district located in central Night City during the Time of the Red. Originally consisting of the former Little Italy and Northside Districts, this area was reimagined after the Fourth Corporate War with a modern Western European architectural style.

By the 2040s, Little Europe had become a booming district in development and a major center of population, serving as a new downtown area for central Night City after the loss of much of the City & Corporate Districts during the war.

## History

### Post-War Reconstruction
After the Fourth Corporate War devastated Night City, reconstruction efforts focused on rebuilding the northwestern area of central Night City. The original plan called for Western European-inspired architecture, taking elements from Italian cities and North American metropolises like Boston, Seattle, and New York City.

By the 2040s, the district featured tightly knit neighborhoods composed of old brick buildings tall standing alongside skyscrapers. However, budget concerns began to outweigh the original planning vision, and the European style started to give way to more conventional architecture.

In 2045, a consortium of executives and fixers known as the Chamber of Commerce sectioned off a portion of Little Europe and renamed it "Downtown," with hopes of it becoming the economic center of the city.

### Transition to Downtown
Over the following years, Little Europe was gradually subsumed by neighboring districts as its traditional-style architecture was deemed unnecessary. Eventually, it became a mesh of entropic and neomilitaristic style buildings, simply known as the new Downtown by the 2070s.
