## Overview

The Lair occupies a whole floor of a large housing complex in South Night City. It was formerly used as the base of operations for a porn troupe led by Mister Studd, the star of many pornographic braindances.

## Description

The Lair was decorated in a 1960s free-love aesthetic, with various weapon lockers hidden under rugs, drapes, and many sex toys. The location features a distinctive retro vibe from the era before the Collapse.

## History (RED Era - 2045)

In 2045, Zhirafa tried to evict all of the complex's residents through questionable methods by sending a boostergang before the legal order could be overthrown. Alone, Mister Studd easily dispatched of all five gangers, sending the remains back to the corp, and releasing for free the braindance of his point of view of what they had been trying to do, shutting down any further operations planned by Zhirafa.
