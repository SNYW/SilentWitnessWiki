# Night City Area Rapid Transit (NCART)



**Type:** Public Transportation System  
**Era:** Time of the Red (2040s)

## Overview

The Night City Area Rapid Transit (NCART) is a rapid transit and public-benefit corporation that provides maglev rail services throughout the Night City metropolitan area. During the Time of the Red, NCART operated under the management of the Dorado Family, a group of reclaimers who created the Reclamation Zone in South Night City.

## History

### Pre-War Era (1994-2020s)

Originally, NCART was mostly an underground subway system. By 2020, it provided maglev rail service throughout the Greater Night City Area, including Central Night City, Heywood, Westbrook, North Oak, Pacifica, South Night City, and Rancho Coronado.

The Transit Center in Little China served as the metro hub, and other major stations included City Center Station (colloquially "The Zoo" due to how easy it was to steal from travelers) and Plaza Center Station ("The Jungle" due to how difficult it was to steal from travelers).

During the Fourth Corporate War and the Night City Holocaust, much of the original infrastructure was disrupted, with periodic flooding, power outages, and many subway tunnels lost to the sea.

### Time of the Red (2030s-2040s)

During the RED era, more subway stations were constructed in anticipation of new neighborhoods, but there wasn't enough population to justify trains stopping at some of them. These dead stations were locked up tight, causing property values to tank. Maintenance workers kept the network functioning, and if bribed, they allowed people to use maintenance tunnels to access unused stations as temporary hideouts.

By the 2040s, the NCART subway system was functioning within the Rebuilding Urban Center of Night City, though some old stations were still subject to flooding during high tides. This prompted planners to consider reconstructing much of the railway system as a monorail above ground.

The Night City Co-Prosperity Sphere (NCCS) funded a high-security monorail loop running between the Executive Zone, Little Europe, Watson Development, and New Westbrook for corpzoners to travel to work.

### 2045 and Beyond

Around 2045, management and operation of NCART was transferred to the Dorado Family. Under them, NCART was able to provide both subway and maglev rail services.
