# Badlands

**Tags:** Badlands, Threat-Medium

**Type:** Wasteland Region  
**Location:** Surrounding Night City, Northern and Southern California  
**Era:** Time of the Red (2040s)

## Overview

The Badlands is a vast arid region that extends across the states of Northern and Southern California, on the West Coast of North America. This desert surrounds most of Night City, making the metropolis appear like a rich oasis by comparison.

During the Time of the Red, the Badlands became even more important as the primary route for Nomad traffic in and out of Night City, as well as a refuge for Fourth Corporate War refugees.

## Geography

The Badlands covers a massive area around Night City:

- **Northern Section:** Dominated by unchecked resource extraction and derelict oil fields
- **Eastern Section:** Wastelands full of chemical waste and landfills; acid rains are common due to massive pollution
- **Southern Section:** Mostly desert; somewhat less apocalyptic due to Biotechnica's protein farms and the Jackson Plains power plant

## RED Era (2040s)

During the Time of the Red after the Fourth Corporate War:

1. **Aldecaldo Camp:** The Aldecaldos nomad family set up a camp on the outskirts of Santo Domingo in Heywood. From this base, they ran an expansive trade and transport network, often hiring themselves out as guides across the desert and transporters of goods.

2. **Refugee Settlements:** Many refugees from the Fourth Corporate War reclaimed abandoned towns and cities not far from the urban sprawl of Night City, forming what became known as the Reclaimed Perimeter.

3. **Nomad Unity:** Unlike the fighting among nomad packs in earlier decades, the RED era saw increased cooperation among nomad families for mutual survival.

## Notable Features

- **Protein Farms:** Biotechnica's agricultural operations in the southern Badlands
- **Northern Oilfields:** Derelict oil extraction facilities
- **Reclaimed Perimeter:** Refugee-built settlements on the edge of the wasteland
- **Aldecaldo Camp:** Primary nomad base near Santo Domingo

## Dangers

- Raffen Shiv (Wraiths) - A dangerous gang of exiles that preys on corporate transports

## Connection to Night City

Despite the dangers, the Badlands are essential to Night City's survival:
- Nomad-controlled transportation networks move goods in and out of the city
- Many refugees use the Badlands as a route to escape the city or seek refuge
- Corporate supply chains rely on nomad-guarded caravan routes
- The Open Road connects Night City to other population centers
