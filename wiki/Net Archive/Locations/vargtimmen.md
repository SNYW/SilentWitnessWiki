**Type:** Neo-Pagan Mead Hall

**Threat Rating:** Low to Medium

## Overview

Vargtimmen (Norwegian for "The Time of the Wolf") is a unique neo-pagan mead hall located in Watson Development, Night City. Famous for its solstice and equinox parties, this establishment attracts a diverse crowd of edgerunners, tech enthusiasts, and those seeking an alternative nightlife experience in the otherwise corporate-dominated district.

## History

### Origins

Vargtimmen was established in the early 2030s during the initial rebuilding of Watson Development. The founders were a collective of neo-pagans and tech workers who wanted to create a space that blended old-world traditions with cyberpunk aesthetics.

The mead hall quickly gained a reputation for its unique atmosphere, combining traditional Nordic mead hall culture with cutting-edge technology. The founders installed state-of-the-art holographic systems that could transform the space to match different seasonal celebrations.

### RED Era (2040s)

By 2045, Vargtimmen has become one of Watson's most well-known establishments. The venue is particularly famous for its seasonal celebrations:

- **Winter Solstice (Yule)** — The biggest event of the year, featuring massive celebrations, mead tasting, and traditional rituals
- **Spring Equinox** — Celebrations of renewal and new beginnings
- **Summer Solstice** — All-night parties during the longest night
- **Autumn Equinox** — Harvest celebrations

## Description
