# The Big Top


## Overview

The base of operations for the Bozos gang.

## Description

The Bozos have converted a large circus-themed venue into their headquarters. Fitting their clown-themed gang aesthetic, the Big Top is a sprawling structure filled with twisted carnival imagery.

## Session 3

Mr Giggles challenged the party to come here if they want to "take it up with them." The location was mentioned as where the Bozos operate from.

## Notes

- Extremely dangerous — Bozo territory
- The party's next confrontation could happen here
- Mr Giggles issued the challenge personally
