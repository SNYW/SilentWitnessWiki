## Overview

Short Circuit is a bar located in the Little Europe district of central Night City. It is a favorite haunt for techies and netrunners, known for its welcoming atmosphere toward those who tinker with salvaged technology.

## History

Short Circuit originally existed as a notable bar located on the top of the Barbican Building in the 2020s. During the Night City Holocaust, the original bar was severely damaged and subsequently abandoned.

In 2040, Brain and 3-Piece rebuilt the establishment in Little Europe, naming it after the original bar as an homage to its predecessor. Since its founding, 3-Piece has used a portion of the third floor as a Night Market, where he sells unique tinkers once every month.

## Layout

Short Circuit is a reinforced three-story building located in Little Europe, very close to the Hot Zone. It has a sizable elevator installed on the exterior wall that goes to all floors, rigged with sleeping gas in case someone sneaks into it. The building is secured by patrolling Zhirafa drones operated by netrunners on a payroll. Additional security includes cameras and biometrical locks.

**First Floor:** Where Brain and the staff serve drinks to techies working on their projects.

**Second Floor:** Usually occupied by netrunners sitting in comfortable chairs and using custom NET Architectures designed to act as virtual clubs.

**Third Floor:** A private family apartment which contains Brain's workshop, 3-Piece's recording studio, and the storage space used for the Night Market joint.

## Notable Features

- **Night Market:** Run by 3-Piece, this monthly market sells carefully repaired salvaged tech, including tech parts, cyberdecks, hardware, and programs. Access requires being a regular customer and receiving an invitation.

- **Tech-Friendly Atmosphere:** Patrons commonly tinker with wrecked tech from around Night City—even from the Hot Zone. The bar provides tools necessary to turn salvaged trash into treasure.

- **Security:** Zhirafa drones keep watch at the entrance to prevent dangerous items from being brought in.
