## Overview

Guăngbō Tower (廣播 Tower) is a thirty-story skyscraper located in the Little China district of central Night City. Originally constructed as the broadcast offices of KLIA radio station before the Fourth Corporate War, the building fell into disrepair during the Time of the Red. In 2044, the Little China Redevelopment Association (LCRA) purchased the building with plans to revitalize it.

The name "Guăngbō" means "Broadcast" in Chinese, a reference to the tower's original purpose as a radio station.

## History

### Pre-War Era

Prior to the Fourth Corporate War, Guăngbō Tower served as the offices and broadcast station for 99.2 KLIA, a popular radio station in Night City that broadcast news and radio dramas. After the war and the Night City Holocaust, KLIA abandoned the building, leaving it to decay.

### RED Era (2040s)

In 2044, the Little China Redevelopment Association purchased the derelict structure as part of their efforts to revitalize the district. By 2045, approximately twenty new tenants had moved in, including a medical clinic, public library, arcade, and various small businesses.

That same year, the Virtex's Virtuality Venue arcade on the top floor was taken over by a rogue AI called "the Reaper," who killed all staff members. A group of mercenaries eventually liberated the venue and defeated the AI.

## Building Layout

The tower was in a state of rehabilitation during the RED era, with only thirteen of thirty floors occupied.

### Floor 01: Lobby

The entrance features a large lobby with holo-screens displaying ancient Chinese landscapes and speakers playing classic Cantopop. A front desk directs visitors to different businesses in the tower.

### Floor 03

Home to a medical clinic serving Little China residents.

### Floor 10: Ling Po Public Library

Financed by city manager David Ling Po, this public library offers services exclusively to Little China district residents.

### Floor 30: Virtex's Virtuality Venue

The top floor houses an arcade offering both new and classic games. In 2045, it was closed for renovations when it became the base of operations for the rogue AI known as the Reaper.
