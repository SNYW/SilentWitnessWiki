## Overview

The Columbarium is an exclusive private burial complex located in South Night City, operated by the Tombstone Preservers gang. It offers high-end crypts, mausoleums, and preservation services for the wealthy dead of Night City.

During the RED era, the Columbarium represents one of the few places in Night City where the deceased can be interred with dignity, protected by the Tombstone Preservers who guard against grave robbers and desecration.

## History

Founded in the early 2040s during the Time of the Red, the Columbarium was established as a premium alternative to the mass graves and anonymous burial pits that became common during the post-war chaos. The Tombstone Preservers transformed an old corporate cemetery complex into a fortified necropolis.
