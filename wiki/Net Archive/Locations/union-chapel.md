## Overview

Union Chapel is an abandoned church building located in the South Night City district of central Night City. During the RED era, it lies within the Combat Zone and has a notorious reputation as a location of dark events.

## History

### Pre-War Era (1990s-2020s)

Union Chapel was constructed as a church building during the initial glory days of Night City in the mid-late 1990s, located southwest of Lake Park. At some point it was abandoned, being fenced off, with its doors and windows boarded up. Over the following years, the former church fell under the Blood Razors territory, and the building's exterior walls were painted with their symbols.

By 2020, the building had fallen into disrepair, with most boards being torn off. That same year, Hubert Treadwell hid inside its walls for some time.

### Time of the Red (2020s-2040s)

After the Fourth Corporate War, Union Chapel was located inside the borders of the Combat Zone of South Night City. The old building was then occupied and transformed into a bar for a time, though it was soon after abandoned once again.

Later, the establishment was used as a lair by Lord Ruthven and his followers, who mostly used the basement as their base of operations. They killed many people, especially gang members, and decorated much of the building's interior with their remains.

### The Kidnappings of 2045

By 2045, the disrepaired structure was surrounded by rubble and had been converted into a nightmare for anyone that visited it. Lord Ruthven had been kidnapping women around the University District with the aim of bodysculpting them to resemble Network 54 news anchor Barbara Dahl. He built a hidden room in the basement which contained an oversized medical pod he used to bio-sculpt his victims.

A mercenary group was hired to find one of the victims, NCU student Lucy Rhinemeyer. After killing Ruthven, the mercs found Lucy, who was the only survivor of that ordeal. Not much later, a group of Reckoners turned the basement as their refuge, giving the abandoned architectural landmark a new purpose.

## Layout (2045)

Most of the building's entrances were blocked by rubble except the main one at the front, which had an open neon sign above. Just outside the doorway hanged two large candelabra handles, and a rolled out carpet made of sewed human skin led inside. The skin carpet displayed many different gang tattoos.

Inside the building there was a large open room with a bar area and dozens of decaying tables and chairs, all occupied by rotten corpses. On the bar counter there was a display of severed cybered heads. At the end of the room there was a stage decorated with blood and human remains.

The basement staircase was littered with ammunition cases, and blood red candles were placed along handrails. A white doorway adorned with red pentagrams and with an upside-down crucifix hanged above it was found at the end. Behind there was an underground chapel room with a row of ten benches covered in the rotten remains of Lord Ruthven's victims, and at the end of the room the body of a borg was bolted to a large metal chrome crucifix.

Behind a tapestry there was a soft white LED illuminated hallway leading into a secret room with an oversized medical pod used by Ruthven to bio-sculpt his victims.
