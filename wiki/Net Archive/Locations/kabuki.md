# Kabuki


## Overview

Kabuki is a sub-district located in the [Watson Development](/wiki/watson-development) area of [Night City](/wiki/night-city), existing during the [Time of the Red](/wiki/time-of-the-red) in 2045. Once a thriving Japanese medical district adjacent to the famous Med Center, Kabuki has transformed into one of the poorest and most dangerous areas of the city.

## History

### Pre-War Origins
Kabuki was originally developed as a Japanese medical district, home to various medical corporations and clinics. The area flourished due to its proximity to the renowned Medical Center, attracting Japanese businesses and residents.

### The Fourth Corporate War
During and after the Fourth Corporate War, the Japanese medical corporations either dissolved or relocated. Arasaka absorbed many competitors, and those that remained moved to other areas. This left Kabuki in economic ruin.

### Time of the Red
In the aftermath of the war, Kabuki experienced a massive influx of Chinese immigrants who transformed the area into a bustling bazaar. The district became known for its black market activities, with narrow alleyways filled with chop suey joints, cosmetic boutiques, and cheap junk shops decorated with Chinese lanternions and flickering neon lights.

By 2045, Kabuki had become the heart of Night City's black market for illegal transactions, including implants, organs, combat drugs, prototype cyber augmentations, steroids, synth-viruses, and illicit braindance recordings.

## Geography

Kabuki is located in the northern part of Watson Development, adjacent to the old Medical Center area. The district features narrow, tangled alleyways rather than the wide urban canyons found in other parts of the city. Its provisional, low-rise architecture allows for open skies and enough sunlight to power solar generators.

The northern edge of Kabuki is characterized by warehouses and abandoned factories that have been occupied by various gangs, transients, and junkies.

- **G3** - Another gang with presence in Kabuki
- **Tyger Claws** - The parent organization of Kimen-Gumi
- **Maelstrom** - Occasionally operates in the northern sections

The Kimen-Gumi maintains their main base at the Nakagawa Kabuki Theater and wears distinctive Oni masks.

## Economy

Kabuki's economy is dominated by the black market. Virtually anything illegal can be purchased in the district if one knows the right people. Legitimate businesses coexist with illegal operations, including:

- Street vendors selling stolen and counterfeit goods
- Food stalls and cheap restaurants
