# The Blackwall

**Tags:** Lore, Net-History, Time-of-the-Red, Technology

## Overview

The **Blackwall** is a massive virtual firewall created by NetWatch that separates the usable, human-controlled portions of the Net from the dangerous, AI-infested ruins of the old NET. During the Time of the Red, it represents humanity's last line of defense against rogue artificial intelligences.

## Origins

### Post-DataKrash

After the catastrophic DataKrash of 2022 — caused by Rache Bartmoss's R.A.B.I.D.S. virus — the original NET was devastated. Countless military-grade AIs were unshackled and mutated into extremely dangerous entities that roamed the ruins of the old network.

NetWatch, the international Net policing organization, was unable to reverse the damage or neutralize these rogue AIs. Desperate to salvage what they could, they undertook an unprecedented project.

### Creation (2044)

In 2044, NetWatch — with help from the Transcendentals (a group of Soulkilled Pseudo-Intellects/ghost AIs) and the Ghosts — secretly began development of what would become known as "the Blackwall."

The project was controversial from the start. Rumors suggest NetWatch was only able to construct the Blackwall with the help of the rogue AIs themselves, who desired to separate themselves from human observation for their own opaque reasons.

## Nature of the Blackwall

### Appearance and Function

The Blackwall is not merely a traditional firewall but appears to be a powerful AI masquerading as ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics). It manifests as a seemingly impenetrable barrier of black code that separates:

- **The usable Net** — Human-controlled networks, CitiNets, and public access points
- **The old NET ruins** — The lawless domain of rogue AIs beyond the Blackwall

### Capabilities

The Blackwall is designed to:
- Block rogue AIs from breaching into human-controlled networks
- Destroy any unauthorized netrunners who attempt to cross
- Self-repair and adapt to new threats
- Monitor all traffic on the human side of the barrier

## The Net During the RED Era

With the Blackwall in place, the Net during the Time of the Red is fundamentally different from the pre-DataKrash era:

### Fragmented Networks
Instead of a globe-spanning open network, the Net consists of:
- **CitiNets** — Corporate-owned local VPNs in Reclaimed Cities
- **Public access points** — Limited NetWatch-monitored entry points
- **Private networks** — Corporate and government systems

### NetWatch Control
NetWatch maintains strict control over public Net access:
- All user activity is monitored
- Harsh punishments for unauthorized access
- Security protocols sent to every Net user

### Dangers Beyond the Wall
The area beyond the Blackwall is:
- Inhabited by rogue AIs of various types
- Extremely dangerous for unprepared netrunners
- Source of both fear and fascination for those who study the old Net

## Crossing the Blackwall

### Risks

Attempting to breach the Blackwall is considered extremely dangerous:
- NetWatch actively hunts unauthorized netrunners
- Rogue AIs may attack or capture intruders
- The Blackwall itself will likely kill or incapacitate violators

### The Voodoo Boys

During the RED era, the Voodoo Boys gang of Pacifica becomes known for their attempts to probe the Blackwall. They believe that if they can make contact with the AIs beyond, these entities will help humanity — or at least help the Voodoo Boys achieve their goals.

## Significance

The Blackwall represents:

1. **Sacrifice** — Humanity gave up access to invaluable resources and knowledge for safety
2. **Paranoia** — Fear of AI is embodied in this massive barrier
3. **Control** — NetWatch's power over the Net is solidified
4. **Mystery** — What lies beyond remains unknown and fascinating

## Concerns

There are ongoing concerns about the Blackwall:
- If it might eventually fail
- Whether the Blackwall AI itself could go rogue
- The ethical implications of the sacrifice humanity made
- What knowledge was lost when the old Net was sealed off

## Timeline

- **2022**: DataKrash devastates the Net
- **2030s**: NetWatch begins attempting to contain rogue AIs
- **2044**: Blackwall project secretly begins
- **2045+**: Blackwall operational, separating human Net from AI territory
