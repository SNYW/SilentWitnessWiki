# DataKrash

**Tags:** Lore, Net-History, Time-of-the-Red, Event

## Overview

The **DataKrash** (also written as **Data Crash** or **Datakrash**) was a catastrophic event that occurred on June 3, 2022, in which the original NET was largely destroyed by the R.A.B.I.D.S. viruses created by the legendary netrunner Rache Bartmoss. This event fundamentally transformed the digital landscape and set the stage for the fragmented Net that exists during the Time of the Red.

## Background

### Rache Bartmoss

Rache Bartmoss was considered the most brilliant hacker in the NET. A rogue netrunner who viewed corporations as the ultimate oppressors of humanity, he spent most of his life on the run with corporate bounties on his head. Bartmoss lived his final days hidden in a disguised cryogenic freezer with life support tech and NET access.

### The R.A.B.I.D.S. Virus

In September 2014, during the release of the Ihara-Grubb Transformation Algorithms, Bartmoss created and planted the R.A.B.I.D.S. (Rogue Artificial Bug Intelligence Data Seeker) virus in the NET as a grand act of defiance against corporate control. The virus was designed to be triggered in the event of his death, intended to breach all corporate datafortresses and unleash their data onto the Net for all to access.

However, the virus had a very different effect than Bartmoss had intended.

## The Event

When the virus was released (triggered by Bartmoss's death), it infected 78.2% of the Net in a matter of months. The consequences were catastrophic:

- **Net traffic came to a grinding halt**
- **Corporations lost billions as the stock market destabilized**
- **Huge amounts of data were corrupted**
- **Countless military-grade artificial intelligences were unshackled and mutated into extremely dangerous entities**

## Aftermath

### Immediate Effects

In the DataKrash's immediate aftermath, the Net was almost unusable. To maintain operations in the short term, many corporations and governments revived the use of 20th-century punch card technology for data entry and security purposes.

### The Blackwall

NetWatch, unable to reverse the damage or neutralize the rogue AIs, decided to create the **Blackwall** — a potent AI with the sole task of blocking off sections of the Net that had been overrun by rogue AIs with ICE, so that the rest of the Net could be salvaged.

Rumors emerged that NetWatch was only able to construct the Blackwall with the help of the rogue AIs themselves, who desired to separate themselves from human observation for their own opaque reasons.

### The Fragmented Net

Upon the completion of the Blackwall a few years after the Krash, the Net stabilized into a very different landscape. Instead of a vast, globe-spanning network of interconnected systems, the Net became fragmented:

- Corporations and other groups set up private Nets they held unfettered control over
- NetWatch ruled over the public-accessible parts of the Net
- All user activity was monitored with no privacy
- Harsh punishments were meted out for anyone attempting to breach the Blackwall

## Legacy

The DataKrash is considered one of the most significant events in cyberhistory. It:

- Ended the era of the open, interconnected Net
- Created the conditions for corporate-controlled CitiNets
- Led to the development of the Blackwall
- Transformed netrunning into a far more dangerous profession
- Set the stage for the Net architecture that exists during the Time of the Red

## Timeline

- **2014**: Bartmoss plants R.A.B.I.D.S. virus in the NET
- **2022 (June 3)**: Bartmoss dies, triggering the DataKrash
- **2020s**: NetWatch develops the Blackwall
- **2030s-2040s**: Fragmented Net stabilizes into CitiNets and the Blackwall-protected public Net
