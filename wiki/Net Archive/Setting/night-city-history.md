# Night City History

**Tags:** Time-of-the-Red, Lore


## Overview

Night City is an autonomous city-state located on the shores of Del Coronado Bay, on the border between North and South California, on the Pacific Coast of North America. It is the main setting for the Cyberpunk franchise.

The city is known as "The City of Dreams" — originally "City on the Edge of Tomorrow." During the Time of the Red, it operates as a Free City in recovery, rebuilding after the Fourth Corporate War.

## Timeline

### 1994 — Founding
Richard Night establishes **Coronado City** on the shores of Del Coronado Bay. Built with corporate backing from:
- Arasaka Corporation
- EBM (Euro Business Machines)
- Petrochem

Vision: A modern metropolis free from crime, poverty, and corruption.

### 1998 — Renaming
City renamed to **Night City** after Richard Night is assassinated.

### 2010s-2020s — The Fall
After Richard Night's death, the city disintegrates into competing districts, ravaged by gangs, and later controlled by megacorporations. The original vision is lost.

The city is divided into Sections A-J:
- Sections A-C: Central Night City
- Section D: The Combat Zone (violent, crime-ridden)
- Sections E-J: Suburbs (Heywood, Pacifica, North Oak, etc.)

### Fourth Corporate War
A devastating conflict between megacorps. Arasaka detonates a nuclear weapon over Night City.

### Time of the Red (约 2020s-2040s)
The nuclear fallout devastates the city:
- The city center becomes the **Hot Zone** — still radioactive and devastated
- The sky stays red for decades
- Majority of population becomes homeless
- Slow rebuilding process begins

During this period, the city is reorganized. Old neighborhoods are rearranged, renamed, or scraped off into the bay if too radioactive. Each new area is governed by a City Manager and given a "threat rating" by the City Council.

Residents mentally divide the city into four areas:
- **The Island**
- **Northside**
- **Mainland**
- **Southside**

Environments include:
- Overpacked Suburbs
- Rebuilding Urban Zones
- Combat Zones

### 2045 — Cyberpunk RED Era
Recovery is underway. The original heart of the metropolis (the Hot Zone) remains devastated. New districts have been established with varying threat levels.
