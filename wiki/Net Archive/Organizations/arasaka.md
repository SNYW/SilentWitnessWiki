## Overview

Arasaka is one of the most powerful megacorporations in the world, dealing in corporate security, banking, and manufacturing. Based in Japan with global operations, Arasaka is renowned for its elite security forces and has a dark reputation built on centuries of calculated expansion and ruthless business practices.

During the Time of the Red, Arasaka has been working to reestablish its presence in Night City after being expelled from North America following the Fourth Corporate War.

## History

### Founding and Early Years

The Arasaka Corporation was founded in 1915 by Sasai Arasaka in Tokyo, Japan. Originally focused on manufacturing, the company took advantage of World War II to expand its wealth and power by supplying the Imperial Japanese Army. When Japan faced defeat, Sasai foresaw the outcome and covertly spread the company's wealth across the globe to protect it from post-war repercussions.

After WWII, Saburo Arasaka (Sasai's son) took control and transformed Arasaka into a global powerhouse. In 1970, he created the Arasaka Security division, which became one of the company's most profitable and feared divisions.

### The Fourth Corporate War

During the Fourth Corporate War, Arasaka was a major combatant against Militech. The conflict culminated in the destruction of Arasaka Tower in Night City in 2023—an event now known as the "Night City Holocaust." Following this disaster, Arasaka was expelled from North America.

However, the corporation survived and has been working to return to the city through proxy operations and the Night City Co-Prosperity Sphere (NCCS).

## RED Era Operations (2040s)

### Night City Presence

During the Time of the Red, Arasaka operates in Night City through:

1. **Tyger Claws Proxy:** Arasaka historically backed the Tyger Claws gang, originally as a motorcycle club in the 2030s. While direct sponsorship ended after the Fourth Corporate War, some connections remain, with potential sleeper agents within the gang.

2. **Night City Co-Prosperity Sphere (NCCS):** This consortium of Japanese corporations works to rebuild Watson Development and surrounding areas. While not directly controlled by Arasaka, the NCCS creates opportunities for Arasaka influence to reassert itself.

3. **Financial Services:** Arasaka Bank maintains global operations and is sought after for secure banking services, even by those who oppose the corporation.

4. **Security Services:** Arasaka Security continues to be the gold standard for corporate and personal security worldwide.

### Family Leadership

The Arasaka family remains in control:
- **Saburo Arasaka** - The aging patriarch who built the modern Arasaka empire
- **Kei Arasaka** - Saburo's son, presumed killed in the Night City Holocaust (though some evidence suggests survival)
- **Michiko Sanderson** - Kei's daughter, founder of Danger Gal (an anti-Arasaka task force)

## Key Holdings

- **Arasaka Security:** World-renowned private military and security contractor
- **Arasaka Bank:** Global banking and financial services
- **Arasaka Manufacturing:** Weapons, vehicles, and consumer electronics
- **Mikoshi Project:** Research into soulkiller technology and digital consciousness

## Reputation

Arasaka is feared worldwide for:
- Elite black-clad security guards deployed globally
- Alleged connections to the Yakuza
- Reputation for eliminating opposition through assassins and legal warfare
- Ruthless pursuit of power and control

## In Night City

Arasaka's return to Night City is a major concern for many residents. The corporation's history of backing the Tyger Claws and its role in the Fourth Corporate War's destruction make it a controversial presence. However, the NCCS's reconstruction efforts have softened some attitudes, especially in Watson Development.
