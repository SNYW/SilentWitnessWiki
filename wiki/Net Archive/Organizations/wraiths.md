## Overview

The Wraiths are the largest and most notorious group of Raffen Shiv (rogue nomads) operating in the Badlands surrounding Night City. They are a vicious gang of exiles from various nomad families who travel primarily at night, preying on the sleeping and unwary. Unlike typical nomads who operate in a judicial grey area, the Wraiths completely ignore the law and are known for their aggressive and ruthless tactics.

## History

### Origins

The Wraiths originated from the many nomad-originating gangs on the West Coast, consisting primarily of exiles from the Seven Nations nomad families. They are believed to have formed as a larger group of Raffen Shiv who were expelled from their families for various transgressions.

During the Time of the Red (2040s), the Wraiths established themselves as the dominant Raffen Shiv group in the Badlands, frequently clashing with the Aldecaldos nomad clan for control of territory and resources.

### Conflict with Aldecaldos

The Wraiths have a long history of frequent conflict and warfare with the Aldecaldos, another prominent nomad group in the Badlands. This rivalry has persisted throughout the RED era and remains ongoing.

## Organization

### Leadership

The gang is led by Dogkiller, a notorious figure rumored to wear clothing made from human skin. The leadership structure is based on strength and ruthlessness rather than family ties.

### Membership

The Wraiths represent the largest concentration of Raffen Shiv, with membership estimated between 300 to 1,200 members - typical for an average nomad clan size. Members are drawn from exiles who have been cast out from their nomad families for serious transgressions including murder, rape, human trafficking, and betrayal.
