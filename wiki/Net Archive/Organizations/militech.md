## Overview

Militech International Armaments, commonly known simply as Militech, is one of the world's largest megacorporations specializing in weapons manufacturing and private military contracting. Based in the NUSA (United States of North America), Militech is the primary military hardware supplier for the NUSA government and military, as well as numerous other nations and corporations worldwide.

During the Time of the Red, Militech has emerged as one of the most powerful megacorporations, having effectively "won" the Fourth Corporate War against Arasaka—though at tremendous cost to Night City and the world at large.

## History

### Founding and Early Growth

Militech was founded in 1996 by Italian weapons designer Antonio Luccessi as Armatech-Luccessi International. The company gained prominence in 2004 when its Ronin Light Assault Rifle won the US military contract, beginning its rise to dominance in the global arms market.

Under the leadership of CEO Donald Lundee, a former US Marine Corps General, Militech rapidly expanded to become one of the world's largest defense contractors. By 2020, the company had facilities on every continent and provided equipment to numerous nations, corporations, and governmental organizations.

### The Fourth Corporate War

Militech's conflict with Arasaka escalated into the Fourth Corporate War, a devastating global conflict that culminated in the Night City Holocaust of 2023. The war ended with Arasaka Tower destroyed by a nuclear device, and both corporations severely damaged.

Following the war, Militech was technically victorious but faced significant scrutiny. The NUSA government took a more active role in regulating corporate military power, and Militech's expansion was somewhat constrained.

## RED Era Operations (2040s)

### Current Status

By the 2040s, Militech has recovered much of its former power and influence:

1. **Military Hardware:** Remains the primary supplier of weapons, vehicles, and equipment to the NUSA military and police forces
2. **Private Military:** Continues to offer PMC services globally, though under closer government oversight
3. **Night City Operations:** Maintains a presence in Night City, though the city remains wary of corporate military power after the Fourth Corporate War

### Night City Presence

Militech operates cautiously in Night City during the Time of the Red:
- Maintains corporate offices in the Reclaimed Perimeter
- Works with local authorities on security contracts
- Competes with Arasaka for security contracts through proxy relationships
- Supported MaxTac development and equipment

### Key Relationships

- **NUSA Government:** Primary customer and regulator
- **Arasaka:** Bitter rival; both corporations nearly destroyed each other in the Fourth Corporate War
- **MaxTac:** Works closely with Night City's elite police tactical unit
- **Nomad Families:** Some tensions over smuggling and border operations

## Products and Services

Militech produces a wide range of military equipment:
- **Weapons:** Rifles, pistols, heavy weapons, melee weapons
- **Vehicles:** Tanks, aircraft, naval vessels, drones
- **Armor:** Assisted Combat Personal Armor (ACPA), body armor
- **Security Services:** Private military contracting, consulting

## Reputation

Militech is known for:
- High-quality military hardware at competitive prices
- Aggressive business practices and corporate rivalry with Arasaka
- Involvement in geopolitical conflicts and regime changes
- Providing equipment to both governmental and non-governmental actors

## In Night City

Night City residents have mixed feelings about Militech. While the corporation helped defeat Arasaka in the Fourth Corporate War, the nuclear detonation that ended the conflict devastated the city center. Many survivors of the Holocaust hold Militech partly responsible for the destruction, even though Arasaka planted the nuclear device.

During the RED era, Militech maintains a lower profile in Night City than one might expect for such a powerful corporation, focusing on legitimate security contracts and avoiding the spotlight.
