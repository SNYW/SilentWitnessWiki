## Overview

The Aldecaldos are one of the oldest and most prominent nomad families in North America, and a member of the prestigious Seven Nations. Unlike many nomad groups, the Aldecaldos maintain a code of honor and prefer to operate through legitimate trade and transport contracts rather than violence.

## History

### Origins (1990s)

The Aldecaldo family was the first true nomad family to form during the Collapse of Los Angeles in the 1990s. Juan Aldecaldo, a former defense industry engineer, led his family and followers on a mass migration from Los Angeles to Mexico City when the city devolved into warzone conditions.

### Early Growth (2000s-2010s)

After establishing themselves in Mexico City, the Aldecaldos prospered. They helped refugees during the Long Walk - the massive migration of nomads across the continent. When they returned to the United States in 2015, they brought new members and established themselves in the Badlands surrounding Night City.

### Leadership of Santiago

Juan Aldecaldo suffered a heart attack and passed leadership to his trusted ally Santiago (who became Santiago Aldecaldo). Under his leadership, the family maintained its traditions and grew into one of the most respected nomad groups in the region.

### RED Era (2040s)

In 2045, the Aldecaldos were known throughout the Badlands for their involvement in:
- Construction work
- Transport services
- Mercenary contracts
- Caravanning across the Free States

During the Time of the Red, the Aldecaldos maintained camps in the Badlands near Night City. They were often hired by businesses and individuals needing safe passage or transport through dangerous territories. Their reputation for reliability made them popular with corps and civilians alike.

The Aldecaldos maintained a long-standing rivalry with the Wraiths, a group of Raffen Shiv (exiled nomads) who operated through violence and raiding.

## Territory

The Aldecaldos do not hold fixed territory but operate throughout the Badlands:
- **Main Camps** - Temporary settlements in the desert regions surrounding Night City
- **Night City Outskirts** - Frequently camp near the city's perimeter, trading with urban inhabitants
- **Nomad Trail** - Maintain routes throughout the Free States on the West Coast

## Sources of Income

- Transport contracts (passengers and merchandise)
- Construction and manual labor
- Bootlegging and smuggling
- Mercenary/escort services
- Trading caravan operations

## Culture and Structure

The Aldecaldos maintain traditional nomad values:
- **Family First** - Strong emphasis on loyalty to family members
- **Honor Among Thieves** - They keep their word and value trust
- **Collective Welfare** - Resources are shared among members
- **Hospitality** - Known for welcoming travelers and refugees

Leadership typically passes to capable individuals rather than by strict inheritance, though family connections still carry weight.

## Notable Members

- **Santiago Aldecaldo** - Long-time leader of the family
- **Saul Bright** - Notable member and rising talent within the clan
- **Panam Palmer** - Promising young member showing skill as a wheelwoman

## Relationships

- **Wraiths** - Arch-rivals; ongoing conflict over territory and philosophy
- **Seven Nations** - Member in good standing; respected among other nomad families
- **Night City** - Cautious trade relationship; occasional contracts with city-based businesses
- **Corporations** - Willing to take contracts but maintain independence

## Vehicles

The Aldecaldos are known for their modified vehicles:
- Heavy trucks and transport vehicles
- Armored caravans
- Modified motorcycles
- Off-road vehicles suitable for desert travel

## Notes

The Aldecaldos represent the "noble nomad" archetype in Night City's mythology - a group that maintains honor and civilization in a chaotic world. During the RED era, they were one of the few nomad groups that urban Night City residents could trust and do business with.

Their presence near Night City provided valuable services: safe transport, labor, and a reminder that not all nomads were dangerous raiders.
