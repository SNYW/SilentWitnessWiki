**Type:** Party Gang
**Era:** Cyberpunk RED (Time of the Red)
**Base of Operations:** Mobile (Piranha Palace)

## Overview

The Piranhas are one of Night City's most notorious party gangs, specializing in throwing exclusive parties and providing "everything anyone could want" for a price. By 2045, they had become the reigning party monarchs of Night City, operating from their mobile headquarters known as the Piranha Palace.

## History

### Origins (2020s)

Around 2020, the Piranhas were a small party gang based in an old convenience store in the Combat Zone in South Night City. The gang was focused on partying, drinking Smash, taking and dealing drugs, and occasionally mugging people—living a "just because" lifestyle.

### Rise to Power (2030s-2040s)

In the 2030s, a young girl known as Corpse Reviver joined the gang and quickly rose through the ranks. After her predecessor died by overdose, Corpse took control and transformed the Piranhas into a serious organization. She absorbed several other two-bit party gangs and organized them into cells known as "shoals."

By the 2040s, the gang operated from the mobile Piranha Palace, shifting locations regularly. Corpse Reviver led as the brains while her right-hand Bazooka Joe handled security and muscle. Other notable members included Dirty Shirley, whose manufactured drugs were considered some of the best in the city.

### 2045 (RED Era)

By 2045, the Piranhas had grown to include some of the city's best:
- Cooks and dealers
- Light and sound crews
- Mixologists and chefs
- VR artists and dancers
- Security teams and bouncers
- Clean-up crews

The gang targeted young and wealthy individuals, luring them into party lifestyles with drugs and fantasies, then taking their money. This gave the Piranhas significant leverage and resources. Corpse Reviver used these resources to lift other kids from the worst areas of Night City and give them jobs—her way of creating her own "fucked-up family."

The Piranhas had notable influence over Playland by the Sea in Pacifica and maintained connections with other gangs like the Andersons.

## Notable Members

- **Corpse Reviver** — Main leader, former Combat Zone kid who transformed the gang
- **Bazooka Joe** — Lieutenant, handles security and trains new members
- **Dirty Shirley** — Head cook, creates some of the best drugs in Night City

## Territory and Operations

The Piranhas operate from their mobile Piranha Palace, which moves to different locations throughout Night City. They throw exclusive parties for wealthy clients, providing:
- Party planning and execution
- Custom drugs and refreshments
- Entertainment (dancers, music, VR experiences)
- Security services

The gang maintains a truce with the Prime-Time Players and has influence over smaller gangs in the party scene.

## Threat Assessment

**Threat Level:** Low-Medium
- Not a combat-focused gang
- More focused on party organization than territorial conquest
- Dangerous due to drug operations and connections to wealthier clients
