**Threat Rating:** Medium-High

## Overview

The Valentinos are one of the largest and most established gangs in Night City, with deep roots in the Latino communities of Heywood. They are known for their strict moral code, religious devotion (particularly to Santa Muerte and Jesús Malverde), and fierce protection of their territory and community.

Unlike typical gangs, the Valentinos operate with a code of honor that emphasizes family, loyalty, and protection of their neighborhood. They maintain many legitimate businesses alongside their criminal operations, making them a complex and enduring presence in Night City.

## History

### Origins

The Valentinos have been present in Night City for over a century, evolving from early Chicano street gangs into the powerful organization they are today. Their traditions trace back to Mexican heritage, and they have cultivated these cultural roots for generations.

### The RED Era (2040s)

By the mid-2040s during the Time of the Red, the Valentinos were considered a small but influential predominately Latino cartel operating in Night City. During this period, they maintained their territory in Heywood while navigating the post-war chaos.

A significant event during this era was a bloodbath in Moto Cielo in which many Valentinos died. Sebastian Ibarra, a Valentino priest who survived the ordeal, found what he considered a noble calling and became a prominent fixer in Night City, eventually gaining the nickname "Padre."

The gang was led during this period by figures like La Llorona and El Sombreron, who made a name for themselves through violent acts against the gang's enemies.

### Philosophy and Structure

The Valentinos operate with a strict moral code bound by:
- Strong family values and brotherhood
- Religious devotion to Santa Muerte (holy death) and Jesús Malverde (the honorable thief)
- Protection of their neighborhood and community
- Honor and loyalty above all else

Members tend to integrate quickly, adopting Chicano culture and celebrating Mexican holidays and customs like Dia de Los Muertos, Quinceañeras, Semana Santa, and Dia de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe.

The community's loyalty protects gang members, making NCPD and corporate infiltration nearly impossible. Betraying one's gang is considered the most heinous crime and is punished severely.
