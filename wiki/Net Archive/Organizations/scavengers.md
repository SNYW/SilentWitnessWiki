# Scavengers

**Type:** Criminal Gang / Cyberware Harvesters  
**Territory:** Multiple (no fixed turf)  
**Threat Rating:** High to Extreme

## Overview

The Scavengers (also known as Scavs) are one of Night City's most notorious and feared criminal organizations. Unlike typical gangs, the Scavengers are not defined by territory or a specific ideology, but by their horrific trade: kidnapping people and forcibly harvesting their cyberware and organs for sale on the black market.

## History

The Scavengers emerged as a side effect of the mass availability of body augmentations in Night City. As cyberware became more common and accessible, so did the opportunity for those willing to harvest it by any means necessary. The group likely formed in the aftermath of the Fourth Corporate War, when the city was plunged into chaos and law enforcement was overwhelmed.

## Organization and Structure

The Scavengers do not operate as a traditional gang with a hierarchy or designated territory. Instead, they function as a loose network of small groups spread throughout Night City. These groups are typically led by the most ruthless, cunning, and savage individuals.

### Key Characteristics

- **No fixed turf** - Scavenger groups can be found throughout Night City
- **Small cell structure** - Operate in small groups of 3-6 members
- **Multi-ethnic membership** - Many members speak European languages, with Russian being common
- **Soviet imagery** - Members often display Russian graffiti, listen to Russian music, and have Soviet-themed tattoos

## Criminal Activities

### Primary Trade: Body Harvesting

The Scavengers' main source of income is the forcible removal and sale of cyberware and organs from their victims. Their victims, often called "donors" by the Scavengers, are selected based on the quality of their cyberware.

### Methods

- **Street ambushes** - Attacking unsuspecting citizens in alleys and dark areas
- **Abduction** - Kidnapping individuals, often from less protected areas
- **Target selection** - They prefer targets with expensive implants

### Victims

Those targeted by Scavengers are typically:
- Edgerunners with valuable cyberware
- Corporate employees with high-end implants
- Anyone who appears vulnerable

### Disposal

After harvesting their victims, the Scavengers ensure no evidence remains:
- Bodies are typically dumped, burned, or left in city sewers
- Cyberware and organs are sold on the black market

## Income Sources

## Notes

The Scavengers represent the darkest side of Night City's underground economy.

They are universally feared and despised, even by other criminals.
