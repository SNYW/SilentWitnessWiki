## Overview

Undertow is a gang operating in [Night City](/wiki/night-city) during the [Time of the Red](/wiki/time-of-the-red). They are primarily associated with the [Little Europe](/wiki/little-europe) district, where they maintain a significant presence.

## Background

Little Europe was a rebuilding urban district in central Night City during the 2040s-2050s, characterized by a mix of old brick buildings and modern skyscrapers. Undertow emerged as one of the gangs controlling territory in this diverse area, which also housed major corporations like Continental Brands and Danger Gal, as well as other gangs including 6th Street, Eurotrashers, and Maelstrom.

The gang's name suggests an aquatic or maritime theme, though their specific origins and specialty are not widely documented in available sources.

## Territory

Undertow is primarily based in Little Europe, a district that by 2045 had become divided between classes and architectural styles, with old brick buildings standing alongside modern skyscrapers. The area was undergoing development projects including megabuildings to house the displaced population.

Little Europe was connected to the Executive Zone and Watson Development by a high-security NCART monorail loop.

## RED Era Status

Undertow is verified as a RED-era organization, appearing in the Night City 2045 Atlas as operating in Little Europe during the Time of the Red.
