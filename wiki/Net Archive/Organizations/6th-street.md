# 6th Street


**Primary Territory:** North Heywood, Santo Domingo  
**Threat Rating:** Medium-High

## Overview

6th Street is a militant gang and former law enforcement contractor in Night City, known for their military discipline and patriotic theme. Founded by veterans of the Fourth Corporate War, they position themselves as protectors of the people, though their methods often blur the line between justice and criminality.

## History

### Origins (2020s-2030s)

6th Street was founded in the mid-to-late 2020s by Colonel Solomon Wright (also known as "X"), a former US military intelligence officer who organized Fourth Corporate War veterans to protect citizens of post-war Night City. They based their operations in a nine-story National Guard armory in North Heywood.

The gang structured themselves around military ranks, using a three-tier leadership system called the "3-I's": Investigations (detectives), Impact (troopers), and Internal (management).

### The RED Era (2040s)

By the 2040s, 6th Street achieved what few gangs ever accomplish — they were deputized as a private law enforcement contractor. They were granted official protection of the streets in North Heywood, patrolling on foot and motorcycles in groups of four to six.

During this period, they maintained:
- Good relations with neighboring nomad groups
- A presence in Little Europe, particularly around Holy Angels Church
- Regular patrols and rapid-response teams

However, despite their official status, 6th Street faced financial difficulties. To pay their bills, they were forced into extortion and smuggling operations, marking the beginning of their drift away from their original ideals.

By 2045, their primary law enforcement unit was Davis Squad, led by Arbiter (Wright's son). They continued to dream of expanding their official status from North Heywood to all of Night City.

## RED Era Status

6th Street represents one of the unique phenomena of the Time of the Red — a gang that achieved semi-legitimate status through contracts with city authorities. During the 2040s, they were simultaneously a protection force and a criminal organization, walking the line between law enforcement and gang activity.

Their presence in North Heywood made them a stabilizing force in one of Night City's more dangerous areas, though their reliance on extortion to supplement their income troubled many who had initially welcomed them as protectors.

## Notable Features

- **Military Discipline:** Unlike typical gangs, 6th Street operates with military hierarchy and protocols
- **Patriotic Theme:** Members display American flags and military-inspired uniforms
- **Anti-Corpo Stance:** Despite their military background, they oppose corporate control of Night City
- **Community Presence:** They maintain a visible patrol schedule and offer protection services

## Relationships

- **Nomads:** Generally good relations, particularly with packs operating in the surrounding areas
- **NCPD:** Complicated — competitors when 6th Street held contracts, but sometimes cooperative
- **Other Gangs:** Generally opposed, particularly the Valentinos (turf wars in later years)
- **Corporations:** Complex relationship — officially opposed but willing to work with them when convenient
