## Overview

The Voodoo Boys are an enigmatic and secretive gang operating from the ruined district of Pacifica in Night City. Despite their name being given to them by outsiders, the gang takes their identity seriously—they follow voodoo traditions with genuine religious fervor, unlike the original 2020-era gang that used it as mere affectation.

## History

The Voodoo Boys originated from Haitian refugees who came to Night City in 2062 after climate change devastated Haiti. These refugees were initially recruited to work on the ambitious Pacifica resort city project, which ultimately collapsed during the Fourth Corporate War. When the project failed, the Haitians remained in the ruined district, eventually forming the Voodoo Boys as self-appointed guardians of the Haitian community.

During the Time of the Red, the gang began their fascination with the Blackwall and the possibility of contacting rogue AIs beyond it. This obsession with the Net would define them throughout the era and into 2077.

## Organization

- **Leadership:** The gang is led by a council of Netrunners, with prominent leaders including Brigitte and Placide
- **Membership:** Exclusively Haitian, requiring proof of Haitian heritage
- **Philosophy:** Deeply tied to voodoo religion; members are devout practitioners
