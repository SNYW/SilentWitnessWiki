# Voodoo Boys

**Type:** Gang / Netrunner Gang  
**Territory:** Pacifica (RED Era)  
**Threat Rating:** High

## Overview

The Voodoo Boys are an enigmatic gang of netrunners based in Pacifica, known for their mysterious reputation and their devotion to uncovering the secrets of the Old Net and the Blackwall. Despite their name being given to them by outsiders, the gang takes their voodoo-inspired identity seriously, incorporating Haitian cultural elements into their gang culture.

## History

### Origins (2040s)

The Voodoo Boys trace their origins to the aftermath of the Fourth Corporate War, when climate change devastated Haiti, literally wiping the nation off the face of the earth. Many Haitian refugees fled to Night City seeking asylum and employment opportunities. A large number of these refugees were drawn to the ambitious Pacifica resort project, which was being developed to transform that district into a luxurious tourist destination.

When the Pacifica resort project collapsed during the turmoil of the Fourth Corporate War's aftermath, the Haitian refugees were left stranded in the district. Labeled as "Voodoo Boys" by locals—who drew superficial parallels to a defunct 21st-century drug gang—the Haitians banded together for protection.

During the RED era (circa 2045), the Voodoo Boys became the self-appointed guardians of the Haitian refugee community in Pacifica. They established themselves as the protectors of the district's predominantly Haitian population, maintaining order where the NCPD had no presence.

The gang also began their probing of the Blackwall in hopes of making contact with rogue AIs beyond the barrier—a dangerous pursuit that drew the attention of NetWatch.

## Philosophy

The Voodoo Boys take their voodoo-inspired identity seriously—a contrast to the original 21st-century gang that merely used it as a pose. Their religion is a deadly serious matter to them, guiding their operations and worldview.

Most members are netrunners, making heavy use of cooling suits and neural implants. Their aesthetic incorporates "voodoo-flavored" elements including dreadlocks, tattoos, and the bones and skulls of small birds and rodents worn as charms.

## Territory

During the RED era, the Voodoo Boys operated primarily in:
- **Pacifica** - Main territory, protecting the Haitian community

## Notes

The Voodoo Boys represent one of the most technically sophisticated gangs in Night City. While other gangs rely on brute force or street-level crime, the Voodoo Boys operate in the shadows of the Net, making them particularly dangerous and difficult to track.

Their pursuit of contact with rogue AIs beyond the Blackwall is considered extremely dangerous—not just to themselves, but to the stability of the remaining Net infrastructure.
