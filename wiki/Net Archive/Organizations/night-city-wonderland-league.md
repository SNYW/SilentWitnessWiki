## Overview

The Night City Wonderland League is a professional roller derby league active in Night City during the Time of the Red. Founded in 2040 by Bastion Norton, a food truck entrepreneur, the league quickly became a popular form of entertainment and gambling in the post-Fourth Corporate War city.

## History

After the Fourth Corporate War disbanded most sports teams in Night City, Bastion Norton stumbled upon photos of his mother playing roller derby for the Coronado Nightcrawlers team. Through a combination of rallying and blackmail, he was able to form the Watson Whammers and South Night City Alices and set up a track in an underground parking garage.

The sport proved a quick success when Fixers realized they could expand their gambling operations with it. The Alice's eventually disbanded as a team and became the governing board, giving communities the training they needed to found their own teams. As of 2045, the Wonderland League recognizes 12 official teams.
