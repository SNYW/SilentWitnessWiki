# Generation Red

**Tags:** Generation-Red, Gang, Combat-Zone, Threat-Medium, Youth-Gang

A-Med yogang (youth gang) created during the Time of the Red, operating in Night City's Old Combat Zone.

## Overview

Generation Red was founded by two teenagers, Apex (Marianna Brooks) and Lookout (Chloe Yannatou), who fled difficult home situations and found sanctuary in the dangerous but free Old Combat Zone. Rather than becoming victims, they built a community of street kids who look out for each other.

## History

### Formation

Apex fled from her corporate parents' home after experiencing abuse at the hands of one of their higher-ups. With the help of her friend Lookout, she set up camp in the Old Combat Zone. The experience left Apex with deep distrust of adults, leading her to put her faith in other kids like herself. Lookout became the gang's sentry, always watching for danger.

### Growth

The gang quickly grew as more kids joined—youngsters whose families were absent, broken, uncaring, or too busy to care for them. Apex provided what they lacked: resources and training to protect themselves in one of Night City's most dangerous areas.

### Notable Members

- **Apex** (Marianna Brooks) — Founder and leader
- **Lookout** (Chloe Yannatou) — Founder and sentry; talented artist who designed the gang's logo
- **Blades** — Essential member, later sponsored by Danger Gal
- **Tetra** (Andrea Olivetti) — Youngest member who brought firepower (a stolen rocket launcher)
- **Wheelie** (Hiroki Nishioka) — Joined later, acts as peacemaker and caretaker
- **Hi-Stick** (LeShawna Johnson) — Essential member
- **Izzy** (Israel Octavius) — Booby-trapped their hideout; connected to Crisis Medical Center
- **Shredder** — Joined later, acts as peacemaker

## Base of Operations

Generation Red's hideout is located in an abandoned building somewhere in the Old Combat Zone. Izzy collaborated with Apex to booby-trap the hideout as a first line of defense against the numerous threats in the combat zone.

The ground floor was transformed into a skate park by Hi-Stick, Wheelie, and Shredder, where they often practice their tricks.

## Relationships

### With Danger Gal

Danger Gal, a notorious detective agency in Night City, saw potential in Generation Red as future employees. They kept an eye on the yogang and even sponsored Blades, hoping to eventually bring the entire group into their fold. However, Apex's deep distrust of corporations and desire for independence proved to be a major obstacle.

### With Other Gangs

The gang has faced attacks from adult gangers targeting their hideout. Despite their small size and limited resources, the kids proved more capable than anyone expected, defending their territory with surprising effectiveness.

## Capabilities

While young and lacking in experience compared to adult gangs, Generation Red makes up for it with:
- Resourcefulness and adaptability
- Booby-trapped defensive positions
- Medical supplies through Izzy's connection to Crisis Medical Center
- Firepower including stolen military-grade weapons

## RED Era Status

Generation Red is a verified RED-era organization, appearing in the *Cyberpunk RED* sourcebook **Danger Gal Dossier** (R. Talsorian Games, 2023). The gang is specifically created during the Time of the Red (circa 2045), making it a canonical RED-era group.
