**Threat Rating:** Low

## Overview

The Shroomers are a unique reclaimer group in Night City during the Time of the Red. Unlike most gangs, they focus on sustainable living, growing mushrooms underground and trading with surface communities. They originated from Night City University students who adapted from growing hallucinogenic mushrooms to cultivating edible varieties during the post-war chaos.

## History

### Origins (2020s)

The Shroomers began as a group of Night City University students who had been growing hallucinogenic mushrooms for recreational use. When the Fourth Corporate War devastated Night City and food supplies became scarce, the group shifted their focus to growing edible mushrooms to survive.

### The Great Fire (2025)

In 2025, their food storehouse was burned down by unknown parties (likely desperate scavengers or rival groups). This catastrophic event forced the group to go underground—both literally and figuratively. They established a hidden village within a disconnected section of the NCART (Night City Area Rapid Transit) track system.

### RED Era Operations (2040s)

By the 2040s, the Shroomers had developed a sustainable underground community. They emerged periodically to trade mushrooms for goods and services they couldn't produce themselves. Their mushroom cultivation has become their primary trade good, with various edible and medicinal varieties.

### Coming of Age

At age 18, Shroomer members are allowed to go on a pilgrimage topside to learn about the outer world. Some choose not to return, which serves as a way to:
- Keep the Shroomers connected to surface events
- Allow outside help when needed
- Provide an escape route for those who want out

## Territory

The Shroomers operate in:
- **Disconnected NCART Track** - Hidden underground village
- **Surface Trading Posts** - Periodic appearances at various markets

## Sources of Income

- Mushroom cultivation and sales
- Trading with surface communities
- Medicinal mushroom products
- Information gathering (through pilgrimage system)

## Notable Members

The Shroomers maintain a collective leadership structure rather than hierarchical command. All members participate in decisions, with older members serving as mentors.

## Relationships

- **Night City University Area** - Their original stomping ground
- **Reclaimers** - Generally peaceful relations
- **Surface Communities** - Trade relationships; viewed as neutral traders

## Notes

The Shroomers represent an unusual phenomenon in Night City's gang landscape: a group that has largely rejected violence in favor of sustainable agriculture and peaceful trade. While they could be considered easy targets, their hidden location and low profile have kept them safe from most threats.

Their underground village is well-hidden, and they go to great lengths to keep its location secret. Those who are allowed to visit are carefully screened, and the group maintains a paranoid level of operational security.
