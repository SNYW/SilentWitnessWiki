## History

### Early Years

Zetatech started as a new high-tech company based in Cupertino, California. The company carved out a small niche in the industry through traditional corporate methods, including strategic espionage and applied violence. After establishing itself, Zetatech attempted to build a reputation by expanding overseas.

### First Corporate War

During the First Corporate War, Zetatech was aligned with Orbital Air and waged a large-scale Net-based attack on Euro Business Machines (EBM). However, EBM was able to repel the attack and knock Zetatech out of the war in October 2004.

### Expansion During the Time of the Red

Following the Fourth Corporate War, Zetatech found itself in an advantageous position to expand. Many rival corporations were weakened or eliminated as a result of the conflict, and Zetatech moved to snatch up many government contracts during the Rebuilding era. This marked the corporation's rise to prominence.

By 2045, Zetatech had diversified their product range, continuing in cyberware and computer systems, but also investing heavily into avionics research and manufacturing. The company became one of the major players in the transportation sector.
