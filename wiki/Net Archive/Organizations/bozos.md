# Bozos


**Type:** Posergang / Boostergang  
**Territory:** Old Japantown, South Night City (RED Era)  
**Threat Rating:** High to Extreme

## Overview

The Bozos are a notorious gang of killer clowns who terrorize Night City's Combat Zones during the Time of the Red. What began as a harmless prankster gang in the 2010s has evolved into one of the city's most feared organizations, known for their twisted "pranks" that border on sadistic torture.

## History

### Origins (2017-2020)

The Bozos first appeared in the West Hill district around 2017. Originally considered a simple prankster gang, members stylized their appearance after circus clowns. However, their bodies were not mere costumes—they had been biosculpted to look exactly like clowns, complete with colorful hair, red bulbous noses, white skin grafted onto their faces to form permanent frowns, and long flat feet.

In 2019, things changed dramatically when they took on a new leader known as the Great Bozo, who created dangerous devices and performed extreme cyberware experiments on members. This turned the Bozos into the ultimate killer clown organization.

### Time of the Red (2030s-2040s)

By the 2040s, the Bozos had become a living nightmare legend of Night City—a seemingly endless legion of violent, bodysculpted clown pranksters who sewn chaos and mayhem wherever they went. Despite their infamy, the existence of the mythical Great Bozo was never confirmed.

The gang established their headquarters at **The Big Top**, a large circus-themed venue in South Night City.

### The Hilaria Events

The Bozos began a yearly event known as **Hilaria** in which they caused as much havoc as possible, including killing, maiming, and running down pedestrians with vehicles.

### 2045 — The Forlorn Hope Incident

During Hilaria 2045, Big Top—one of the most powerful Bozo leaders—kidnapped people to be brainwashed and biosculpted for an attack on the Forlorn Hope bar, a notorious solo hangout. On a Wednesday night, Bozos arrived in school buses and opened fire, killing eleven people before being driven off.

This event sparked an internal power struggle within the gang, with Big Top declaring independence from the Great Bozo and sparking a civil war among the Bozos.
