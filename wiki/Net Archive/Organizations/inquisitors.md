# Inquisitors

**Tags:** Cult, Threat-Extreme

**Territory:** Mobile / No Fixed Turf (RED Era)  
**Threat Rating:** Very High

## Overview

The Inquisitors are one of the most feared and unique gangs in Night City's history. More a cult than a traditional gang, they hold an absolute hatred for all forms of cyberware, considering it evil and blasphemous. Unlike other gangs that rely on cybernetic enhancements, the Inquisitors rely solely on training and bioware improvements. They are at war with every other gang in the city, and nearly everyone else considers them enemies.

## History

### Origins (2020s)

The Inquisitors emerged in Night City during the 2020 era as an anti-cyberware cult. Their philosophy centered on the belief that cyberware represented a corruption of humanity. They gained notoriety for their violent opposition to any gang or individual using cyberware.

Their "soul saving" practice involved forcibly removing cyberware from victims—a brutal procedure that often left victims dead or severely injured. This earned them the hatred of virtually every other criminal organization in Night City.

### Conflicts (2020s)

The Inquisitors were responsible for the death of the younger brother of Hack Man, leader of the Blood Razors. This act triggered a blood feud, with the Blood Razors placing a standing reward of 25,000 credits for anyone who could capture the Inquisitor leader and bring them to justice.

They also fought against the Iron Sights gang in the Rainbow Nights club, resulting in significant casualties on both sides. When Maelstrom was formed, they recruited members of the Iron Sights who held personal grudges against the Inquisitors.

### Time of the Red (2040s-2045)

By the RED era in 2045, the Inquisitors had continued their operations. Their practice of tearing cyberware out of people's bodies continued to earn them the hatred of everyone in Night City.

Unlike other gangs, the Inquisitors did not wear distinctive gang colors, making them difficult to identify. Members appeared indistinguishable from average citizens—neighbors, coworkers, or the person behind the counter at a bodega. This made them particularly dangerous and difficult to track.

## Philosophy and Beliefs

The Inquisitors believe that cyberware is:
- Evil and blasphemous
- A corruption of true humanity
- Something that must be "saved" through forceful removal

Their extreme ideology drives them to attack anyone who uses cyberware, regardless of whether that person is a gang member, corporate employee, or ordinary citizen.

## Organization Structure

### Membership
- No fixed criteria for joining
- Members use only bioware (no cyberware)
- Can appear as ordinary citizens
- Members vary greatly in combat capability

### Operations

## Notable Relationships

### Enemies
- **Blood Razors** - Ongoing blood feud, bounty on leadership
- **Iron Sights** - Historic battle at Rainbow Nights
- **Maelstrom** - Natural enemies due to extreme cyberware usage
- **Every other gang** - Considered enemies by most organizations

### Targets
The Inquisitors consider any cyberware user a target, including:
- Boostergang members
- Corporate employees
- Ordinary citizens with cyberware
- Mercenaries and fixers

## Territory

The Inquisitors do not maintain a fixed territory. Instead, they operate as a mobile cult, moving throughout Night City to conduct their "missions." This makes them difficult to pin down and allows them to strike anywhere.

## Threat Assessment

**Threat Level: Very High**

Despite their relatively small numbers, the Inquisitors represent a unique threat because:
1. They have no fixed territory to target
2. Members blend in with ordinary citizens
3. They attack without warning
4. Their ideology attracts the mentally unstable
5. Nearly everyone wants them dead, giving them a common enemy with almost all other factions

## Notes

The Inquisitors represent one of the most extreme factions in Night City's history. Unlike typical gangs motivated by profit or territory, they are driven by a fanatical ideology that makes them unpredictable and dangerous to everyone. Their existence spans from the 2020 era through the RED era, making them a persistent threat across multiple decades.
