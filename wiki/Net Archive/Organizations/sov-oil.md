## Overview

SovOil (Soviet World Oil Industries) is one of the most powerful corporations in the Neo-Soviet Union, serving as the primary economic force controlling much of Eastern Europe. Originally state-owned oil industries of the USSR, SovOil broke away from government control in 2002 and became an independent corporation.

By 2045, during the RED era, SovOil had diversified beyond oil into mining, shipbuilding, research, aircraft, computers, synthetics, and CHOOH2 power systems. The corporation remains the dominant economic power in the Neo-Soviet Union and much of Eastern Europe.

## History

### Origins

SovOil traces its roots to the Soviet Union's state-run oil industry (KeroSov). After the USSR collapsed and was reorganized into the Union of Sovereign Soviet Republics in 1994, the oil industry was restructured. By 1997, SovOil emerged as the dominant oil corporation in the region.

### Corporate Independence

In 2002, SovOil's security commander Sergei Kirsanov, following orders from Director Anatoly Novikovo, locked down SovOil company sites and announced the corporation's independence from the Soviet government. The USSR state forces couldn't retake the facilities without destroying them and risking the oil supply, so they had to acknowledge SovOil's independence.

### Diversification

By 2045, SovOil had begun diversifying beyond oil as the world's petroleum reserves dwindled. The corporation invested heavily in mining, shipbuilding, CHOOH2 agriculture, aircraft manufacturing, computers, synthetics, and general agriculture to prepare for a future without oil.

## Operations in Night City

While SovOil is primarily based in the Neo-Soviet Union, the corporation maintains international operations and would have presence in major markets like Night City. Their CHOOH2 fuel production and other products would be available in Night City during the RED era.
