## Overview

The Iron Sights are a notorious boostergang that has operated in Night City for decades, surviving from the 2020 era through the Time of the Red. Originally an Arasaka-financed gang, they have evolved into a feared combat gang operating in the Combat Zones during the RED era.

## History

### Origins (2010s-2020s)

The Iron Sights originated in the 2010s as one of the few gangs in Night City financed by Arasaka Corporation. The gang had an open membership policy—anyone could join, with ranking determined by how much cyberware a member had installed. As a result, their leaders were heavily chromed individuals.

The Sights gained a reputation for causing trouble in clubs and bars, looking for fights, and shaking down anyone they targeted for money. In 2013, Iron Sights members were present in Arasaka Tower helping defend against intruders during the Never Fade Away incident.

They also fought against the Inquisitors gang in the Rainbow Nights club, a battle that resulted in significant casualties on both sides. When Maelstrom was formed, it recruited members of the Iron Sights who held personal grudges against the Inquisitors.

### Decline and Resurgence (Fourth Corporate War)

At the end of the Fourth Corporate War, when Arasaka was expelled from North America, the Iron Sights lost their corporate funding. This made them vulnerable, and they were soon attacked by the Red Chrome Legion—marking the beginning of a long-standing feud between the two gangs.

### Time of the Red (2040s)

By the 2040s, the Iron Sights had become a relatively small but tough combat gang composed mostly of borderline cyberpsychos. Despite their reduced numbers, they were known for their ferocity.

During this period, they found a new benefactor—the fixer known as Hornet. Using his connections, Hornet provided the gang with military-grade equipment, allowing the Iron Sights to once again become a force in the Combat Zone. This new power led to renewed conflict with the Red Chrome Legion.

### The Iron Sights War (Mid-2040s)

The conflict escalated when the Red Chrome Legion attacked one of Hornet's convoys, stealing hardware and crates containing neurotoxins. This sparked a full-scale war within the Combat Zone that became so dangerous MAX-TAC had to intervene, as regular NCPD couldn't handle the gang's borged-up members.

The Iron Sights ultimately managed to push the Red Chrome Legion out of Old Japantown and into southern Little China. They used the Ionic Semiconductor Building in the Old Combat Zone to stash family members for safety.

### 2045 Status

By 2045, the Iron Sights had been at war with the Red Chrome Legion for over a year. Despite their smaller numbers, they had become a powerful force in the Zone. However, the new Red Chrome Legion leadership ultimately defeated them in a series of battles, though the Legion did not push to fully claim their territory.
