## Overview

Tsunami Defense Systems (also known as Tsunami Design Bureau or Tsunami Arms) is one of the four largest weapons manufacturers located in Japan and is considered one of the top-tier weapons manufacturers in the world. The corporation is known for its secretive nature, innovative designs, and high-end custom weaponry favored by solos and wealthy mercenaries.

## History

### Origins

Tsunami was founded by three friends—Toshio Yamabatsu, Timothy Davidson, and Michelle Teguchi—in Osaka, Japan. The company began as a Japanese airgun company, born in the Net, which gave it an eclectic and loosely organized structure unlike the standard hierarchy of large corporations.

### Transformation

When the Japanese government made it possible for private companies to obtain weapons production licenses in 1998, Tsunami was quick to acquire one. The company went on to become a secretive, innovative entity and a favorite weapons manufacturer of otakus. Tsunami also provided custom/special orders for those with the wealth to make such requests.

### 2010s-2020s Expansion

For many years, Tsunami operated as a top-secret organization, working strictly behind the scenes, providing designs to governments, wealthy solos, athletes, and select corporations. However, from 2017 to 2020, they expanded their services into the mass market, leading to massive and rapid economic growth.

By 2020, Tsunami was one of the four major weapon suppliers of Japan's Self Defense Force. Despite being a relatively small company, Tsunami was considered a top-grade weapons manufacturer.

## Products

### Railguns and Energy Weapons

Tsunami produced an extensive line of limited-issue weapons including:
- Railguns
- Lasers
- Special-purpose weaponry
- Powered armor sidearms
- Specialized handguns

### Custom Weapons

Many of Tsunami's custom weaponry were competition pieces designed for athletes and professionals. The company utilized the latest in computer-assisted design and manufacturing equipment, maintaining a reputation for being ahead of the competition in leading-edge technology.

### Research and Development

Tsunami's R&D department was notably their smallest branch, despite the company being at the cutting edge of most areas of technology. This was attributed to a small, well-chosen crack team of researchers and Net-surfers.

## Notable Events

### Muramasa Incident

At some point, a rogue AI named 'Muramasa' was stolen/escaped from its parent creator, the Arasaka Corporation, and was employed by Tsunami. In Japan, rumors circulated about its asylum with the company, although Tsunami flatly denied such claims.

Arasaka placed a bounty on the retrieval of Muramasa, which enticed the notorious AI hunter known as 'Blackheart' to begin searching for its whereabouts. To counter this threat, Tsunami contracted a team from Night City to travel to Hong Kong and intercept Blackheart.

## RED Era Significance

During the Time of the Red, Tsunami Arms maintained its position as one of the world's premier weapons manufacturers. The company continued to design and produce weaponry and weapons paraphernalies for solos and corporate militaries alike.

Tsunami's products were highly sought after in Night City and other major markets. Their combination of cutting-edge technology and custom manufacturing capabilities made them a favorite among wealthy edgerunners and corporate forces during the RED era.

## Presence in Night City

Tsunami weapons are commonly found throughout Night City, particularly among wealthy edgerunners and corporate security forces. Their high-quality, innovative designs command premium prices but are known for reliability and performance.

## Competitive Position

Tsunami is considered one of the top four weapons manufacturers globally, competing with:
- Militech (USA)
- Arasaka (Japan)
- Kang Tao (China)

Unlike its competitors, Tsunami maintains a more secretive and specialized approach, focusing on quality over quantity.
