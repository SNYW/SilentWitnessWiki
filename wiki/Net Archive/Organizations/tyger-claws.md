## Overview

The Tyger Claws are one of the largest and most powerful gangs in Night City during the Time of the Red. Originally founded as an Arasaka-backed motorcycle club in the 2030s, they evolved into a guardian gang protecting Japanese communities under the sponsorship of the Night City Co-Prosperity Sphere (NCCS).

## History

### Origins (2030s)

The Tyger Claws began as an Arasaka-backed motorcycle club that operated in the original Japantown and surrounding residential areas. By 2020, they had grown into a small combat gang, protecting the local Japanese population thanks to Arasaka financing. Their members used enhanced reflex boosters and martial arts as their preferred weapons.

### Post-War Transformation (2023+)

After the Night City Holocaust of 2023, the Tyger Claws—having been used as a proxy gang by Arasaka—were left to their own devices when the megacorp was kicked out from North America. Fortuitously, they were soon contacted by the newly formed Night City Co-Prosperity Sphere (NCCS), a conglomerate of Japanese-based corporations.

Led by famous actor Shinobu Nakagawa, the NCCS reformed the gang into a guardian gang known as the Tyger Claws, with the objective of protecting Japanese communities in Night City. To accomplish this, they formed a sub-group called the Kimen-Gumi, which operated as a legal entity with security contracts, often collaborating with the NCPD.

### RED Era (2040s)

By the 2040s, the Tyger Claws had established their headquarters at the Nakagawa Kabuki Theater in Kabuki. They also maintained a base of operations in Old Japantown, where they worked to rebuild sections of their former home. The Kimen-Gumi provided public-facing security services while the broader gang controlled various revenue-generating activities in their territory.

Notable members during this period included Hayato Nakagawa, the adoptive son of Shinobu Nakagawa, who quickly rose through the ranks due to his talent as a gangster.

## Notes

During the RED era, they served as both protectors and exploiters of the Japanese community, walking a fine line between legitimacy and criminality.
