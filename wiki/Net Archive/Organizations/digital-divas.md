## Overview

The Digital Divas is an electric punk band active in Night City during the Time of the Red. Known for their provocative lyrics and high-energy performances, they quickly gained notoriety in 2045.

## History

In 2045, Digital Diva concerts became infamous for a series of after-show arson cases. Residents of various Blocks believed that the provocative lyrics of Digital Diva songs were responsible for these arson attacks. Sizzle Jams, the band's promoter, considered these arson cases as a chance to get more publicity.

The band decided to hire a group of edgerunners to capture the arsonist. The arsonist was identified as Bev Hatric, secretary at DyneTech. Following this incident, the Digital Divas band exploded in popularity and initiated a range of social commentaries.

During one of their concerts, a Ziggurat Netrunner named Jezz Stiles died after stepping in front of a passing truck. Although originally ruled as a suicide, her mother, Militech freelancer recruitment specialist Major Veronica Stiles, launched her own investigation and determined her daughter's death was related to a rogue AI known as the Reaper.

## Base of Operations

The band operates from an abandoned cinema in the east of Heywood's Industrial Zone. Their manager, Sizzle Jams, handles their finances, pays them just enough to survive, and covers the expenses of their living and rehearsal space.
