# Sightseers

**Tags:** Gang, Badlands, Threat-Low

A nomad pack of the Aldecaldos family, introduced in Cyberpunk RED.

## Overview

The Sightseers are a small nomad family that specializes in the transportation of small goods and the escort of people through the Badlands. Founded by Racer Rajavi, they operate as a self-sufficient crew within the larger Aldecaldos nomad nation.

## Base of Operations

The Sightseers make their home in the East Cargo Village, a strip of cargo containers on the outskirts of Santo Domingo. This location places them in regular contact with Night City while maintaining their nomad lifestyle.

## Resources

The pack owns several motorbikes and a modified kombi suitable for moving cargo. Unlike some nomad packs that rely on their parent family's resources, the Sightseers are self-sufficient. Each member owns their own cyberware and equipment.

## Notable Members

- **Racer Rajavi** — Founder and leader of the Sightseers
- **Endo** — Named the pack after joining

## RED Era Status

The Sightseers are a verified group from the Time of the Red (circa 2045), appearing in the Cyberpunk RED sourcebook *Danger Gal Dossier* (2023).

## Relations

The Sightseers maintain ties to the Aldecaldos main family and have access to their resources when needed. Recently, tensions between the Aldecaldos and the Night City Police Department have been ramping up due to the arrests of two Sightseers members.
