# The Andersons



**Type:** Yogang (Youth Gang)  
**Home Territory:** Old Combat Zone, Night City  
**Threat Rating:** Low

## Overview

The Andersons are a small but tight-knit yogang (youth gang) operating in Night City during the Time of the Red. Unlike most gangs in theCombat Zone, the Andersons have a reputation for being relatively civilized—they don't steal from their neighbors and have moved away from a life of crime toward salvaging and trading.

## History

### Origins

The Andersons originated as a group of five orphans who were living on the streets of the Combat Zone. These homeless children banded together for survival, forming a found family of sorts. Through necessity and street wisdom, they learned to scrape together enough money to afford a single apartment, giving them a legitimate base of operations.

### Working for Rex Royale

After securing their apartment, the gang began working for a Fixer known as Rex Royale. This connection provided them with steady work and protection within the dangerous Combat Zone neighborhood. However, eventually the gang had a fallout with Royale and parted ways with the Fixer.

### Life After Rex Royale

Following their departure from Royale's employ, the Andersons moved out of their apartment and expanded their ranks, taking in two new members. Rather than returning to crime, they focused on salvaging valuable materials from the ruins of the Old Combat Zone and selling their finds at Molly's Night Market—an underground market located in a parking structure.

## Members

The Andersons are unique in that all members share the surname "Anderson," chosen to reflect their status as a found family. Each member has matching "ANDERSON" knuckle tattoos that identify them as part of the gang.

### Known Members

- The original five founding members (names not specified in sources)
- Two additional members who joined after leaving Rex Royale

## Activities

### Salvaging Operations

The primary activity of the Andersons is salvaging materials from the Old Combat Zone. The Combat Zone's ruins contain numerous valuable items from the pre-War era, and the gang has become expert at finding, extracting, and trading these materials. This occupation keeps them away from the more violent aspects of gang life while still providing income.

### Night Market Trading

The Andersons sell their salvaged goods at Molly's Night Market, an underground market operating in a parking structure. This market is a neutral ground where various factions come together to trade, providing the Andersons with a relatively safe venue to conduct business.

## Relationships

### With Other Gangs

The Andersons maintain good relations with the Piranhas, another Night City gang. This alliance provides them with additional protection in the dangerous streets of the Combat Zone.

### With Fixers

While they previously worked for Rex Royale, the Andersons now operate independently, taking jobs as they see fit rather than working under a single Fixer.
