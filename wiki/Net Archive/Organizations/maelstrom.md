**Type:** Combat Gang / Boostergang  
**Territory:** Watson Development (formerly Hot Zone / Burleson Tower)  
**Threat Level:** High  

## Overview

Maelstrom is a violent combat gang with a "might makes right" philosophy. During the Time of the Red, their leader Warlock transformed Maelstrom into a surprisingly effective criminal enterprise. The gang is notorious for excessive cyberware augmentation, with many members hovering on the edge of cyberpsychosis—or well past it.

### Origins History (2013-2023)

Maelstrom was formed in Night City after 2013 by Hammer, a former member of the Metal Warriors combat gang who was thrown out for breaking the gang's combat code. When the Metal Warriors were nearly wiped out by the Inquisitors, surviving members joined Hammer to form Maelstrom.

The gang's symbol—a fist clenched around a hammer surrounded by a whirlwind—became a feared sight in Night City's streets. Their philosophy was simple: anything was permitted, with no codes or rules.

During the Fourth Corporate War and the Night City Holocaust of 2023, Maelstrom's original hideout was shielded from the nuclear blast by Bayview Condos. However, most heavily cybered members died in an EMP-induced frenzy of hyper-violence immediately after the explosion, including Hammer. The survivors, led by Crusher, fought through the burning city to reach Burleson Tower, where they took control of the Totentanz club.

### The Red Decades (2023-2045)

Following the war, Maelstrom stabilized under Crusher's leadership. He led survivors to Burleson Tower, where they defeated the Warrior Heart gang in a battle for control of the building. The gang displayed the charred mummified corpses of their fallen comrades—including Hammer's—in the hotel's ballroom as a mark of honor.

Crusher was eventually replaced by Hextra after disappearing during a cyberpsychotic episode in 2027. The young Warlock then took leadership, backed by lieutenants Quake and Flenser. Under Warlock's leadership, Maelstrom grew into a powerful criminal organization.

By the 2040s, Maelstrom had:
- Established a flourishing drug and cybernetic trade
- Built a network dealing with ripperdocs across Night City
- Controlled valuable salvage operations in the Hot Zone
- Maintained the Totentanz club as their headquarters and revenue source

### The Search for a New Home (2045)

By 2045, the poor condition of Burleson Tower led Warlock to task Flenser with finding a new permanent home for the gang. After searching through Watson Development, they found an abandoned hotel under construction that would become their new base, with the upper floors converted into the new Totentanz club.
