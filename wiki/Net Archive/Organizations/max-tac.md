## Overview

MaxTac (Maximum Force Tactical Division) is a specialized C-SWAT rapid response unit within the Night City Police Department. As the apex predators of the NCPD, MaxTac specializes in dealing with dangerous cyberpsychos and situations that regular officers cannot handle. They are the most combat-capable and heavily augmented officers in Night City.

## History

### Origins (2000s)

During the 2000s, cyberpsychosis became a serious problem across the United States, particularly in heavily populated urban areas. Standard law enforcement was not equipped to handle metal-armored, cyber-boosted maniacs going on killing sprees. The US government began creating specialized tactical units to hunt down and capture or kill murderous cyberpsychos.

These Cyborg Suppression Units (C-SWAT) became common across urban police departments, operating under various names including MAX-TAC (Maximum Force Tactical Division). Members were equipped with the best available weapons and cyberware.

### Fourth Corporate War Era

During the Fourth Corporate War and the subsequent Night City Holocaust, MaxTac was severely depleted. However, Commander Max Hammerman managed to keep the remaining MaxTac forces together through sheer force of will. 

### Time of the Red (2030s-2040s)

During the RED era, MaxTac operated independently from the NCPD. Commander Hammerman maintained iron-fist control over any and all suspected cyberpsychotic elements in Night City. He rebuilt MaxTac from the ground up, moving from neighborhood to neighborhood to shut down ad-hoc protection rackets and recruit new officers.

By 2030, MaxTac was fully re-established as the premier cyberpsycho suppression force in Night City. The unit continued to hunt down dangerous cyberpsychos throughout the 2040s, including targets like Hextra, the leader of Maelstrom.

## Organization

MaxTac operates in SPAR teams (Special Purpose Assault Rescue). Each team is equipped with:
- Military-grade armor
- Heavy weaponry designed to take down heavily cybered individuals
- Advanced cyberware
- Specialized vehicles

Many MaxTac officers are chromed to the point they themselves are on the watch list for cyberpsychosis. The NCPD's "fight fire with fire" strategy is considered effective, though controversial.

## Equipment

MaxTac weapons are specifically designed to take down heavily augmented individuals, including:
- High-caliber rounds capable of penetrating any armor
- Non-lethal options
- Experimental weaponry
- EMP weapons (rare, as they affect the team as much as the target)

## Mission Profile

MaxTac's primary missions include:
1. **Cyberpsycho Suppression** - Hunting down and neutralizing individuals who have crossed into cyberpsychosis
2. **High-Risk Tactical Operations** - Any situation where regular SWAT has failed
3. **Overwhelming Force Responses** - Situations threatening innocent lives that regular officers cannot handle

## Notes

- Death is the typical outcome for any cyberpsycho hunted by MaxTac; capture and rehabilitation are rare
- Some MaxTac officers are former cyberpsychos, forcefully recruited after being apprehended and reconditioned
- MaxTac funding remains a priority for the NCPD due to their visibility and public relations value
- During the RED era, MaxTac was independent from the NCPD chain of command
