## Overview

The Mox (also called "Moxes") are a unique gang in Night City, formed from the survivors and supporters of Lizzie Borden—a strip club owner who was murdered by the Tyger Claws in 2067. Unlike traditional gangs, the Mox operate more as a protective union for sex workers, outcasts, and sexual minorities. Their name comes from the old slang term "moxie," representing determination and fighting spirit.

## History

The Mox were founded in 2067 following a tragic incident. Elizabeth "Lizzie" Borden, a former prostitute who owned a strip club in Kabuki, was known for treating her workers fairly. When one of her dancers was murdered by Tyger Claws members, Lizzie took brutal revenge—killing three of the assailants with an axe and displaying their bodies outside her club. That same night, Tyger Claws raided and killed Lizzie.

Her death sparked riots across Night City, and her ideological successors rebuilt her club (naming it "Lizzie's Bar") and formed the Mox to protect those who felt threatened and oppressed.

## Philosophy

The Mox believe in:
- Mutual self-defense and protection of sex workers
- Solidarity among outcasts, punks, and sexual minorities
- Non-aggressive territorial expansion (they don't seek turf)
- Supporting their members through legitimate business ventures

## Organization

- **Leadership:** Less hierarchical than other gangs; Susie "Q" serves as leader
- **Membership:** Open to sex workers, anarchists, punks, and sexual minorities
- **Structure:** Cooperative-style with shared decision-making
- **Code:** "Those who protect working girls and guys"
