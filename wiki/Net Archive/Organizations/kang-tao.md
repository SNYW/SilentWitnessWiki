## Overview

Kang Tao is a weapons manufacturer that originated in Taiwan and was later restructured into a Chinese-based company. By the 2040s during the Time of the Red, Kang Tao had become one of the top-tier weapons manufacturers in the world, known for their innovative "smart-gun" technology and aggressive business practices.

## History

### Taiwanese Origins (2000s-2040s)

Kang Tao was originally headquartered in Taiwan, which became a manufacturing haven in the late 2000s after declaring independence with help from Japan and Arasaka. Unlike other Taiwanese companies, Kang Tao maintained its independence by not selling out to Japanese business interests. The company manufactured weapons distributed throughout Asia, which eventually made their way to the United States.

During the DataKrash, the CEO of Kang Tao at the time committed suicide.

### Restructuring (2040s-2050s)

In the aftermath of the Fourth Corporate War, Asia was ravaged by war and unrest which left many countries crippled and deeply scarred. China was no exception as it recovered from internal turmoil.

The restructuring of Kang Tao began in 2046 with the appointment of former army colonel Shiming Xu to manage what was considered an obsolete and collapsing corporation kept afloat by government subsidies. After four years under Colonel Xu's direction, the modernized and debt-free firm officially debuted on the market in 2050 with their A-22B Chao "smart" pistol.

Thanks to the company's alleged government connections, Kang Tao invested heavily in modern research facilities, rapidly expanding the "smart weapons" market. Throughout the next 20 years, through new research facilities funded by the government, Kang Tao overcame its old rivals, coming out as a top-tier weapon manufacturer on par with Tsunami Arms and Arasaka.

### Security Services

Kang Tao has also become an important player in the mercenary and security markets, providing both equipment and personnel to various clients.

## RED Era Significance

During the Time of the Red (late 2040s), Kang Tao was in the midst of their transformation from a struggling Taiwanese company to a global weapons powerhouse. The corporation's bold choices and government backing allowed them to rapidly expand during a period of global instability.

By 2045, Kang Tao was establishing itself as a major competitor in the weapons manufacturing market, though they had not yet reached the peak influence they would achieve in the 2070s.

## Presence in Night City

Kang Tao exports weapons to Night City and other markets. Their products are popular among gangers and edgerunners who appreciate the reliable and inexpensive brand. The corporation has expressed interest in expanding their presence in Night City, particularly in the Pacifica district.

## Corporate Culture

Kang Tao's public relations have remained consistent since their restructuring in the 2050s. The corporation maintains close ties with the Chinese government, which has helped keep them out of legal trouble in most international dealings.

However, relations with other corporations are often strained, as Kang Tao has made various efforts to steal from competitors through corporate espionage.

## Employment

Kang Tao is considered one of the top corporations to work for in Night City. The company provides employees with a Trauma Team Gold insurance package, though they require employees to sign a 50-year loyalty pledge.
