**Type:** Megacorporation  
**Headquarters:** China (originally Taiwan)  
**Founded:** 2000s (Taiwan)  
**Restructured:** 2046 (moved to China)

## Overview

Kang Tao is a major weapons manufacturer that underwent a significant transformation during the Time of the Red. Originally a Taiwanese company that maintained independence from Japanese corporate interests, it was restructured in the 2040s into a Chinese-based corporation that rapidly became a top-tier weapons manufacturer.

## History

### Origins (2000s-2020s)

Kang Tao was originally headquartered in Taiwan, which became a manufacturing haven in the late 2000s after declaring independence with help from Japan and Arasaka. Unlike other Taiwanese companies, Kang Tao maintained its independence by not selling out to Japanese business interests. The company manufactured weapons distributed throughout Asia, which eventually made their way to the United States.

During the DataKrash, the CEO of Kang Tao at the time committed suicide.

### RED Era Restructuring (2040s)

In the years after the Fourth Corporate War, Asia was ravaged by war and unrest. China, like many countries, was recovering from internal turmoil, but this period also presented opportunities. The restructuring of Kang Tao began in 2046 with the appointment of former army colonel Shiming Xu to manage what was considered an obsolete and collapsing corporation.

After four years under Colonel Xu's direction, the modernized and debt-free company officially debuted on the market in 2050 with their A-22B Chao "smart" pistol. Thanks to the company's alleged government connections, Kang Tao invested heavily in modern research facilities and rapidly expanded into the "smart weapons" market.

Throughout the 2050s and 2060s, Kang Tao overcame its old rivals through new research facilities funded by the Chinese government, emerging as a top-tier weapon manufacturer on par with Tsunami Arms and Arasaka.

### 2077

By 2077, Kang Tao had tripled its stock value since 2072, becoming a leading weapon exporter in Asia. The corporation is mainly known for its firearms, especially their "smart-guns" that employ gyrojet technology to fire caseless guided ammunition.

## RED Era Operations (2045)

In 2045, Kang Tao was in the midst of its rise to prominence following the restructuring. The corporation was expanding its presence in major cities and seeking to establish itself as a premier weapons manufacturer. During the Time of the Red, Kang Tao represented a new generation of Asian corporate power that was challenging the traditional Japanese megacorp dominance.

## Products

- **A-22B Chao** — "Smart" pistol, the first major product after restructuring in 2050
- **Smart Weapons** — Gyrojet-powered caseless guided ammunition systems
- **Military-grade firearms** — Various weapons for military and paramilitary use

## Night City Presence

During the RED era, Kang Tao was working to establish a foothold in Night City. By 2077, they had expressed interest in the Pacifica district, though no official deals were made. The corporation is considered one of the top four corporations to work for in Night City, offering Trauma Team Gold insurance but requiring a 50-year loyalty pledge.

## Notes

Kang Tao represents the rise of Chinese corporate power during the Time of the Red. Their aggressive expansion and government backing made them a major player in the weapons industry, challenging established Japanese corporations like Arasaka and Tsunami Arms.
