## Overview

The Jodes are one of the largest nomad groups in North America and a member of the Seven Nations. While they primarily operate in the Badlands and surrounding regions, they maintain strong connections to Night City and have been known to ally with local communities within the city proper.

## History

### Origins (1998)

The original Jode family came from Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas. They were driven out not by economic crisis, but by ecological catastrophe—as the agricultural lands died, the people who worked them began to die as well. In 1998, the great sandstorms made farming impossible, and those with strength began heading west toward California.

The refugees settled briefly in Colorado, where they were attacked by locals. This unwarranted attack resulted in over four hundred deaths. The survivors formed a council and created the original "Compact" that would become the basis of the Nomad Code:

- Protect your family first, then protect the Clan
- Steal nothing from the others in the Clan
- Hoard nothing that could benefit others in the Clan

### Early Prosperity

After the Los Angeles earthquake of 1998 devastated the city, the Jodes beat out more experienced nomad groups for a lucrative rebuilding contract. They worked hard and prospered, eventually moving into the Northwest to cultivate burnt-out forest lands.

### Time of the Red

During the RED era, the Jodes maintain their presence near Night City, operating in the Badlands and occasionally entering the city proper. They have established alliances with various communities within Night City, particularly in the South Night City area.

## Organization Structure

### The Nomad Code

The Jodes strictly adhere to the Nomad Code established by their founders:
- Family comes first
- No stealing from clan members
- Resources are shared within the clan

### Membership

The Jodes are known for their acceptance of strangers, which historically made them suspect among other nomad clans. However, this openness has allowed them to grow into one of the largest nomad families in North America.

## Relations with Night City

### Allies

- **Zoners:** The Jodes have provided allied support to the Zoners in South Night City, though they prefer to stay out of direct protests
- **Local Communities:** Various settlements in the Badlands and outskirts

### Neutral Stance

The Jodes maintain a neutral stance toward the various factions within Night City. Their primary concerns are:
- Trade routes through the Badlands
- Family protection
- Alliance obligations

## Notable Characteristics

- **Acceptance:** Known for welcoming strangers into their ranks
- **Adaptability:** Survived ecological disasters and thrived through rebuilding contracts
- **Independence:** Prefer to operate outside Night City proper but maintain city connections

## In Popular Culture

The name "Jode" was originally a reference to the Okies in Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath," first used in a CNN news segment in 1998. The clan has embraced this identity over time.
