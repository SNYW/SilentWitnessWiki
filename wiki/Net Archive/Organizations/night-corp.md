## Overview

Night Corporation (commonly stylized as Night Corp) is a development firm and public works corporation headquartered in Night City. Originally founded by the city's founder Richard Night, Night Corp serves as the largest contractor for public procurements within Night City's boundaries, building and renovating infrastructure throughout the city.

## History

### Origins (1990s)

The corporation began as Night International, founded by Richard Night in the early 1990s. Under the Coronado Partnership with Arasaka, EBM, and Petrochem, Night International built the city that would become Night City. After Richard Night's assassination in 1998, his wife Miriam Night restructured the company into "Night's Foundation."

### Dark Period (2000s-2010s)

During the Mob War (2009-2011), Night's Foundation struggled to maintain the city's welfare as crime overwhelmed the streets. Unable to gain megacorporate support to restore order, Miriam realized that to have power in Night City, one had to play by corporate rules. The foundation was restructured into Night Corporation.

### Time of the Red (2023-2040s)

Following the Fourth Corporate War and the destruction of the old City Center, Night Corp played a central role in Night City's reconstruction efforts. The corporation:

- Funded and built the new government district, The Glen
- Upgraded NCPD facilities, including the First Division headquarters in The Glen
- Managed public infrastructure projects across all recovering districts
- Maintained controversial charity programs for orphans and scholarships

In 2045, Night Corp became embroiled in controversy when South Night City Zoners discovered funds had been redirected from their district to upgrade NCPD facilities in The Glen.
