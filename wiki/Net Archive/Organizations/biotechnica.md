# BioTechnica


**Type:** Megacorporation  
**Headquarters:** Global (has facilities in Night City)  
**Founded:** Early 1990s, Rome, Italy

## Overview

BioTechnica is one of the world's largest biotechnology corporations, specializing in genetic engineering, biotechnical research, pharmaceutical development, and microbiological products. The company rose to prominence in the late 1990s following its development of CHOOH2, a synthetic grain alcohol fuel that became a global standard.

## History

### Origins (1990s)

BioTechnica began as a small company based in Rome, Italy. In 1991, amidst a global energy crisis, the company developed CHOOH2 (a complex grain alcohol produced by genetically engineered yeasts and wheat strains) as an alternative fuel. Lacking production facilities to meet global demand, BioTechnica licensed production to major petrochemical companies including Petrochem and SovOil. CHOOH2 eventually became the standard fuel worldwide.

### Expansion (2000s-2020s)

Capitalizing on its success, BioTechnica grew into a megacorporation. The company established facilities worldwide including Rome, Venice, Berlin, Bonn, Paris, London, Hamamatsu, La Jolla, Seattle, Dallas, Night City, Sydney, and Rio de Janeiro.

In 2004, BioTechnica conducted controversial human cloning experiments at their Night City research facility. By 2020, they achieved their biggest breakthrough: producing the first self-aware fully functional human clone.

The corporation also worked on environmental restoration projects, cloning animals and developing crops like FrostCorn that could grow in various climate conditions.

### Time of the Red (2023-2040s)

During the Fourth Corporate War, BioTechnica maintained neutrality, allowing them to survive with minimal damage. They supplied both Militech and Arasaka during the conflict.

In the RED era, BioTechnica continues operations in Night City with facilities in the University District (Lake Park area) and other locations. The corporation is involved in various public and private research projects.
