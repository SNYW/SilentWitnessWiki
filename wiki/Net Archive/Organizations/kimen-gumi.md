# Kimen-Gumi

**Tags:** Organization, Tyger-Claws, Time-of-the-Red, Corporation


A public security subgroup of the Tyger Claws, established during the Time of the Red.

## Overview

The Kimen-Gumi serves as the public face and "police" arm of the Tyger Claws gang. Formed after the Fourth Corporate War when the Tyger Claws were reformed into a guardian gang by the Night City Co-Prosperity Sphere (NCCS), the Kimen-Gumi provides legitimate security services while maintaining connections to the parent gang's criminal operations.

## History

After the Night City Holocaust of 2023, the Tyger Claws—originally an Arasaka-backed motorcycle club—were reorganized by the NCCS to protect the Japanese community in Night City. The Claws created the Kimen-Gumi as their public image, operating as a legal security entity with contracts throughout Kabuki and Old Japantown.

The group often deputizes itself as law enforcement in specific parts of the city and has been known to collaborate with the NCPD. Members wear distinctive Oni masks, giving them a frightening but disciplined appearance.

## Organization Structure

- **Captain:** Takeru "Burai" Akagi
- **Hanmen (Lieutenants):** Masashi "Masa" Miyamoto
- **Hanmen (Half-mask Squad Leaders):** Various trusted soldiers

The leadership is sometimes referred to as the "Kabuki Rangers" due to their distinctive red masks and those worn by their lieutenants.

## Territory

The Kimen-Gumi maintains offices in both Kabuki and Old Japantown, with their main base at the Nakagawa Kabuki Theater.

## RED Era Status

The Kimen-Gumi is a verified RED-era organization, appearing in the Cyberpunk RED sourcebook *Danger Gal Dossier* (2023).
