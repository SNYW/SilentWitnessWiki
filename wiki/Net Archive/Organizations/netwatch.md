**Tags:** NetWatch, Law-Enforcement, Net-Policing, Global-Agency, The-Time-of-the-Red

**Type:** International Net Policing Organization  
**Headquarters:** London, England  
**Active Regions:** Global (including Night City)

## Overview

NetWatch is a worldwide Net policing organization created as part of a unilateral UN treaty. During the Time of the Red, NetWatch serves as the primary agency responsible for patrolling the Net, preventing illegal activity, and containing dangerous AIs. The organization works closely with governments and corporations, and is known for its NetCops—highly skilled netrunners equipped with powerful software to pursue criminals in cyberspace.

## History

### Origins (2013)

NetWatch was founded in 2013 through a treaty between the United States and the European Economic Community (Eurotheatre). Originally based in London, England, the organization was empowered to protect and serve the citizens of the World Communications Network. Its initial focus was patrolling the Net to prevent illegal activity.

### The DataKrash and Aftermath

After the DataKrash of the late 2010s—caused by Rache Bartmoss's viral attack—the Net collapsed into chaos. Rogue AIs roamed the ruins of the Old Net, threatening corporations and governments alike. NetWatch's focus shifted from simple policing to containing these dangerous artificial intelligences.

### Time of the Red (2030s-2040s)

During the RED era, NetWatch oversaw the development of corporate CitiNets—local VPNs established in Reclaimed Cities around the world. In 2044, NetWatch, helped by the Transcendentals and the Ghosts (Soulkilled Pseudo-Intellects), secretly started development of a project called "The Black Wall" (later known as the Blackwall). This massive firewall was designed to secure an area of cyberspace for human use while holding at bay the dangerous rogue AIs released during the DataKrash.

NetWatch agents during this period were tasked with:
- Pursuing unlicensed netrunners
- Securing data fortresses
- Removing software threats
- Maintaining the Blackwall
- Apprehending those who attempted to breach the Blackwall

## Organization Structure

### NetWatch Ranks

- **NetCops** - Standard NetWatch agents
- **Wolves** - Aggressive pursuit agents
- **Weasels** - Stealth and intelligence agents
- **The Icemen** - Cold logic-based operators

### Resources

NetWatch receives funding, equipment, and personnel from:
- Governments
- Corporations
- International organizations

Their agents are equipped with very powerful software and Black ICE programs capable of killing or maiming opposition.

## The Blackwall Project

The Blackwall is NetWatch's most significant project during the RED era. Officially begun in 2044, it represents a massive sacrifice—humanity gave up access to invaluable resources and knowledge for safety. The Blackwall essentially splits old network systems in half, creating a barrier between the usable Net and the chaotic ruins of the Old Net.

Interestingly, the Blackwall is not merely a firewall but appears to be a powerful AI masquerading as ICE. This has led to concerns about whether the solution might become a problem if the Blackwall itself goes rogue.

## NetWatch in Night City

During the Time of the Red, NetWatch maintains a presence in Night City. They are particularly focused on:

- Monitoring netrunner activity in the Combat Zones
- Preventing unauthorized access to corporate networks
- Tracking groups attempting to breach the Blackwall (such as the Voodoo Boys)
- Coordinating with local law enforcement when net-based crimes cross into physical territory

## Notable Activities

### Conflicts

- Ongoing conflict with rogue AIs in the ruins of the Old Net
- Battles with unlicensed netrunners
- Rivalry with groups like the Voodoo Boys who seek to breach the Blackwall

### Operations

- Development and maintenance of the Blackwall (begun 2044)
- Oversight of CitiNet development in Reclaimed Cities
- Corporate data security contracts

## Public Perception

NetWatch portrays itself as defenders of humanity—claiming that without their work, the Net would have collapsed. However, critics point out that it's not hard to become a "public enemy" in NetWatch's eyes, as their security protocols are sent to every Net user.
