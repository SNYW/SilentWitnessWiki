**Tags:** Danger-Gal, Security-Corp, Crew-Allied, The-Time-of-the-Red, Night-City, Anti-Arasaka, Arasaka-Opposition

**Type:** Private Investigation, Bodyguard, and Security Corporation  
**Headquarters:** Night City  
**Founded:** Circa 2025 by Michiko Sanderson  

## Overview

Danger Gal is a high-end private investigation, bodyguard, and security corporation headquartered in Night City. The company was carefully constructed by Michiko Sanderson, the daughter of Kei Arasaka, as part of a secret agreement with President Elizabeth Kress to remain in the United States after the Fourth Corporate War. While officially a private investigation firm serving wealthy and socially prominent clients, Danger Gal secretly operates as an anti-Arasaka task force.

The company's public-facing operatives are known for wearing tactical outfits with exotic cat themes, earning them the nickname "the cat gang" by some. Despite their playful public image, Danger Gal has become one of the most formidable security firms in Night City.

## History

### Founding

After the Fourth Corporate War ended in 2025, Arasaka was forced to pull most operations back to Japan. Michiko faced deportation but successfully pleaded her case to President Kress in Washington D.C., remaining in Night City as an American citizen. She attended Stanford University, graduated with a degree in criminology, and founded Danger Gal.

### Growth in the RED Era

By the 2040s, Danger Gal had grown into one of the most sought-after detective firms in the world. Michiko created Puma Squad as the company's public face in Night City—a team of elite operatives who handle both covert operations and high-profile security contracts.

In 2045, Danger Gal HQ was infiltrated by an unknown party but was successfully defended by Puma Squad and other operatives. The company has continued to take on dangerous missions while secretly working against Arasaka operations in Night City.
