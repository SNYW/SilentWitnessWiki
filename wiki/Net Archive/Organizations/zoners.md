## Overview

The South Night City Zoners, commonly called just "the Zoners," are a unique phenomenon in Night City — a protest movement that evolved into an informal gang during the Time of the Red. Originating in the Combat Zone of South Night City in the 2040s, they represent displaced residents who grew frustrated with the unequal distribution of resources away from their district toward wealthier areas of the city.

## History

### Origins (2040s)

The Zoners emerged in the early 2040s when residents of the Combat Zone in South Night City noticed that resources meant to reinvigorate their district were consistently being redirected to wealthier parts of Night City. A small group of dedicated activists formed to legally protest this neglect.

They initially sought permission from the district City Manager to hold demonstrations, but when authorities discovered their motivations, their request was denied. Undeterred, the Zoners protested anyway, and their pleas went unheard — but more locals began joining their cause.

After their second demonstration, the NCPD began monitoring their growing numbers and started sending riot police into the Zone to suppress them.

### Evolution into a Gang

Over months of protests and NCPD raids, the Zoners established their home in a central-northern portion of South Night City. Most members lived in two large housing complexes, with others joining from nearby cargo container communities and tent cities.

They held meetings twice monthly to discuss objectives and share limited resources. Being inside a Combat Zone meant they could loot cyberware and weaponry from dead boostergangers — a grim but effective way to arm themselves.

The local unofficial fire department, led by Tearjerker and her second-in-command Forty Mike-Mike, became an essential part of the group. They advocated for peace but weren't afraid to use violence to save lives.

### The 2045 Uprising

In 2045, tensions reached boiling point when the Zoners discovered that Night Corp had redirected their funds to upgrade the NCPD First Division headquarters. The protest exploded spontaneously — even the leaders were caught off-guard.

For the first time, Zoner protesters left South Night City and accessed The Glen, marching toward police headquarters. While the NCPD constructed barricades, they couldn't match the Zoners' numbers and were soon overwhelmed. Someone threw a Molotov cocktail, kicking off a massive brawl that lasted hours and caused substantial property damage. The fight ended when fire erupted in nearby buildings, forcing everyone to flee.

After this event, the Zoners realized they needed more than demonstrations to succeed — but they had not yet formalized into a proper gang, lacking infrastructure and a solid base of operations.

## RED Era Status

The Zoners represent a unique RED-era phenomenon — a grassroots movement born from the neglect of the Combat Zones during the Time of the Red. By 2045, they had grown from a small protest group into a significant force capable of challenging the NCPD directly.

Their evolution from activists to quasi-gang reflects the broader pattern of community organization in Night City's most neglected districts. Unlike typical gangs focused on territorial control or profit, the Zoners remain driven by their original mission: securing resources and recognition for South Night City's residents.
