## Overview

The Animals are an aggressive street-fighting gang known for their obsession with physical prowess and peak human strength. Unlike most gangs that rely heavily on cyberware, the Animals focus on body enhancement through custom-brewed steroids, hormones, and biological augmentation. They roam Night City in packs, selling their services as bouncers and bodyguards while engaging in underground fight clubs.

## History

The Animals emerged during the 2060s and 2070s as a unique phenomenon in Night City's gang landscape. While other gangs competed for territory and engaged in traditional criminal enterprises, the Animals pursued what they called "the feral"—a primal ideal of human evolution beyond the limitations of normal flesh.

## Philosophy

The Animals believe that true human potential lies in physical perfection. They:
- Reject excessive cyberware in favor of biological enhancement
- Focus on achieving superhuman strength through custom anabolic compounds
