# Executive Zone

**Type:** Gated Community / Executive District  
**Area:** Near New Westbrook (Northeast of Central Night City)  
**Threat Rating:** Very Low

## Overview

The Executive Zone was a gated community carved out of the hills surrounding Night City during the Time of the Red. Reserved exclusively for the wealthiest corporate elites and their families, it represented the ultimate in secure luxury living in post-war Night City.

## History

### Formation (2020s-2030s)

After the Fourth Corporate War devastated Night City, refugees from around the metropolitan area flooded the surrounding suburbs, constructing tent cities everywhere. The wealthiest residents of old Westbrook — previously known as the Executive Estates — decided to wall themselves off from the chaos. They constructed the Executive Zone, a fortified portion of the hills separated from the rest of Westbrook by the highest security money could buy.

Over the following years, New Westbrook grew around the Executive Zone as an urban sprawl, still gleaming with glitz and glam but packed with homeless citizens who fled other areas of Night City due to the war or were pushed out by gentrification in the Rebuilding Urban Center.

### The RED Era (2040s-2045)

By the 2040s, the Executive Zone was considered one of the safest areas in Night City. The district featured luxury homes, private shopping facilities, recreational amenities including tennis and golf courses, private spas, and exclusive clubs. The City Council assigned it a threat level of "Executive" — essentially meaning it was the safest zone in the city.

Patrolled by corporate security forces including the private security firm Lazarus, the Zone was sealed off from the outside world. A high-security NCART monorail station was built within the Zone, connected by a sealed terminal requiring an entry pass. The monorail formed a loop connecting the Executive Zone to Little Europe and Watson Development.

Despite the luxury, tent cities still surrounded the walled community, something that displeased the wealthy residents. By 2045, development had begun on Charter Hill around the Executive Zone.

### Later Development

Eventually, the wealthy residents of the Executive Zone decided to expand their paradise. After paying off city officials to legitimize their expansion, they hired mercenaries to remove the refugees and eventually reformed the area into what became known as Westbrook in later years.

## Notes

The Executive Zone represented the extreme inequality of the Time of the Red — while most of Night City struggled to rebuild from the devastation of the Fourth Corporate War, the wealthiest residents insulated themselves in fortified enclaves, far from the chaos and poverty that surrounded them.
