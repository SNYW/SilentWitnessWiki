# Morro Rock

**Type:** Island / Spaceport Complex  
**Area:** Del Coronado Bay (Off the coast of The Island)  
**Threat Rating:** Low to Moderate

## Overview

Morro Rock is a volcanic island located in Del Coronado Bay, off the western coast of Night City's The Island district. Originally a small volcanic neck formed 23 million years ago, the island has been significantly expanded through fill operations and now hosts Night City's primary spaceport facility.

## History

### Pre-War Era

Before the Fourth Corporate War, Morro Rock was a small island with limited development. The area was historically significant to local Native American tribes. During the late 20th century, the surrounding region was controlled by violent biker gangs until Richard Night purchased the terrain and established Night City.

### Fourth Corporate War and Time of the Red

Morro Rock survived the Fourth Corporate War and the 2023 AHQ Disaster that destroyed much of neighboring Night City. During the Time of the Red (2030s-2040s), the island remained relatively unsettled while the rest of Night City rebuilt.

### RED Era (2040s)

In the 2040s, the Night City government partnered with Orbital Air to construct a mass driver within Morro Rock. The project aimed to launch spaceplanes into low Earth orbit. Construction began in 2045 but was halted when geological engineers raised concerns about bedrock stability.

The project was eventually cancelled, and the incomplete mass driver was dismantled. Instead, Orbital Air built a civilian spaceport, greatly expanding the island through terrain rearrangement. The NCX Spaceport (Night City International and Translunar Spaceport) was finally inaugurated in 2047.

## Locations

### Orbital Air Housing Blocks (2045)

Temporary housing for Orbital Air workers during the mass driver construction project.

### Orbital Air Mass Driver (Cancelled)

The incomplete remains of the original space launch facility. The rusted structures were eventually dismantled.

### NCX Spaceport

Night City's primary civilian spaceport, serving global and eventually translunar travel. The spaceport features:
- Multiple launch pads
- Passenger terminals
- Cargo facilities
- Connecting bridge to City Center

## Getting There

- **By Air:** NCX Spaceport serves both domestic and international flights
- **By Road:** The Night City Ringroad connects to Morro Rock via Union Street bridge
- **Ground Transport:** Corporate or military escort recommended for ground travel in the 2070s

## Reputation

Morro Rock offers some of the best views of Night City, particularly during fireworks displays. The spaceport is popular among:
- Business travelers
- Corporate personnel
- Space enthusiasts
- Tourists seeking a different perspective of the city

## Notes

- Morro Rock Radio (107.3) primarily served Orbital Air workers during construction
- The island represents Night City's ambitions beyond Earth during the RED era
- The geological concerns that halted construction were cited by engineers from Kenya
- The spaceport's completion marked Night City's emergence as a spacefaring city
