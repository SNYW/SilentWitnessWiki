## Overview

A developing district built up by the Night City Co-Prosperity Sphere (NCCS), an alliance of various corporations (primarily of Japanese origin).

## Locations

### (N1) City Police Precinct #3
A large, well-armed police precinct. The egos of some cops here took a bruising when they were unable to break up the labor strike.

### (N2) HTown
A tent city built outside the walls of a gated community. Tensions are high.

### (N3) Petrochem & SovOil Joint Temporary Housing Solution
In a twist of irony, both Petrochem and SovOil provide employee housing in the same building. No one is happy about it.

### (N4) Petrochem Offices
The heavily defended headquarters of Petrochem in Night City. There's a small museum dedicated to the history of petroleum. Across the street from the SovOil Offices.

### (N5) Red Oktober
A Soviet-themed bar built into an old subway station.

### (N6) Redline
Home of the most thrilling bloodsport in Night City and the Wild Things, a gang dedicated to organized competitive violence.

### (N7) Sakura's
A Night City interpretation of an izakaya, an informal bar.

### (N8) Smash/Cut
An EDM club where the chromed up go to dance, do drugs, and have anonymous sex.

### (N9) SovOil Offices
Night City headquarters for SovOil. Completely off-limits to the public. Across the street from the Petrochem Offices.

### (N10) Trauma Team Corporate Living Center
Housing for Trauma Team employees.

### (N11) Trauma Team Tower
Night City headquarters for Trauma Team. Includes an AV repair bay and a hospital for the exclusive use of Executive-level clients.

### (N12) Vargtimmen
A neo-pagan mead bar. Famous for their solstice and equinox parties.

### (N13) Watson Central Cubelife
A bog standard cube hotel.

## Notes

Watson is the NCCS's pet project — a rebuild zone designed to become the new heart of Night City. Lucius Rhyne's election was a major upset against the corporate powers that be.
