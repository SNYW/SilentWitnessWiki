## Appearance

Huge, broad guy built like a tank. Looks like Reinhardt without the helmet — big grey beard, lots of burn scars, and a face that's clearly seen some fights. Wears heavy armor and carries a massive reinforced riot shield.

## Background

Ronnie grew up working class and joined NCPD early. He worked riot control and earned the nickname **Roadblock** because once he planted his shield, nothing got past him.

Years ago a terrorist called the **Warlock of the Glow-Eyed Queen** set off an experimental weapon in Ronnie's district. The blast was basically nuke-level. Ronnie tried to protect his family with his shield but the explosion wiped out the whole block. He survived. They didn't.

After that he left the police and eventually started running with the Vultures.
