# Session 2: The Vault

## Overview

The crew ventures into a bombed-out facility to locate and extract a mysterious subject.

## Events

### Approach
- The crew made their way to the bombed-out facility
- Activated the Akira-style lift into the complex

### Exploration
- Encountered and killed several **cryo-zombies**
- Looted cybertech from the fallen zombies for Magpie to scavenge
- Found one zombie with a **keycard**
- Scanned the keycard to gain entry to the main chamber

### The Inner Chamber
- Opened the door to the inner chamber
- Discovered a large, square highly technological unit containing a **young girl** in cryosleep
- The girl is small enough to be carried by two people
- Removed the girl from the unit

### Escape
- Escaped before the facility was buried in unknown cryo gel
- Alarms triggered upon removal of the girl
- Doors started closing
- Water-based cryogenic fluid began seeping into knee-high water, flash freezing

### Confrontation
- Successfully evaded the **Bozos** who were searching for them
- Bozo pursuers led by **Mr Giggles**, the horrific 2nd in command
  - Description: Bozo gang leader with surgically removed lips, always smiling

### Return
- Made it back to the hideout safely
- Pulled the girl out of the pod — she didn't stir
- Given to **Bekah** for safe keeping

## NPCs Involved

| NPC | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| **Mr Giggles** | Active | 2nd in command of Bozos, horrific appearance, surgically removed lips |
| **Cryo-Zombies** | Deceased | Killed by the crew, dropped cybertech |
| **Mysterious Girl** | Retrieved | In cryosleep, now in Bekah's custody |

## Loot

- Cybertech from cryo-zombies (for Magpie)
- Keycard (for entry to main chamber)

## The Vault Details

### Layout
- Sprawling facility filled with cryo tubes
- Multiple rooms that can be looted
- Each looted room: roll for cyberware and condition

### Dangers
- **Cryo-zombies**: Reanimated corpses in cryo pods
- **Combat encounters**: Certain actions (disabling pods, removing cyberware from corpses) trigger combat with cyber zombies

### Final Room
- Large, square technological unit
- Contains a young girl in cryosleep
- Perfect in every detail
- Size: small enough to carry with both hands by two people

### Alarm Consequences
- Upon removing the girl, the entire facility lights up with alarms
- Doors start closing
- Water-based cryogenic fluid seeps into knee-high water
- **Flash freezing**: If party members get touched by ice, they need a body check to get out
- **Frostbite**: Starting a round in ice causes damage

## Plot Threads

- The mysterious girl — who is she? Why was she in cryo?
- Bekah is now guarding the girl
- Bozos are still hunting the party (led by Mr Giggles)
- The vault facility — more to explore?
- Mr Giggles — confrontation inevitable?

## Notes

- Session ended with the party successfully extracting the girl
- The Bozo threat remains active
- The mystery of the girl and the vault deepens
