## Overview

Club Atlantis was a legendary nightclub in central Night City, serving as the premier hangout for the city's fixers, solos, and netrunners during the Time of the Red. Located in The Glen district, it was known for its upscale, executive appeal with stylized architecture and glamorous interiors.

## History

### The Time of the Red (2040s)

During the aftermath of the Fourth Corporate War, Club Atlantis found itself within The Glen—a new district under development aimed at becoming the new governmental center of Night City. Despite the city's reconstruction efforts, the club maintained its reputation as an exclusive hub for mercenary business and information dealing.

By the 2040s, Club Atlantis had evolved into an executive-style establishment, offering a more glamorous, upscale design to its patrons. Its reputation attracted a diverse clientele of professional mercenaries, corporate operatives, and street-level fixers.

## Notable Features

### Night Market Events

Mister Kernaghan regularly hosted his Night Market events on two floors above Club Atlantis. These exclusive quarterly gatherings featured rare and valuable merchandise, with only one hundred invitations extended to the city's most prestigious dealers and buyers. Danger Gal was hired to provide security during these high-profile events.

### Atmosphere

The club featured disorienting, uniquely styled architecture reminiscent of a "House of Stairs" design—cleverly placed cantilevered stairs, angled mirrors, and special effects that created a surreal environment for patrons.

## Legacy

Club Atlantis was eventually superseded by the Afterlife in Watson during the 2070s. While the Afterlife catered primarily to solos and netrunners with a more exclusive admission policy, nostalgic old-timers claimed it lacked the wildcard diversity of the Atlantis era, where anyone could walk through the doors regardless of reputation.
