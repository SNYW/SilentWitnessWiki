# Old Japantown

**District Code:** H

## Overview

Most of Night City's ethnic Japanese population has moved north, but enough still cling together here to form islands of civilization in a sea of combat zone chaos.

## Government

- **City Manager:** Adriane Casselle (elected by local family heads)
- **Security Provider:** Kimen-Gumi
- **Gangs Present:** Iron Sights, Maelstrom, Red Chrome Legion, The Shroomers, Tyger Claws

## Locations

### (H1) Crisis Medical Center
A no-questions asked medical center supplied with surprisingly advanced technology. Multiple Corps use it as a staging ground to run medical experiments.

### (H2) Highcourt Plaza Hotel
A classy and well-defended hotel providing excellent service. Most guests arrive via AV to avoid driving through a combat zone.

### (H3) Honest Hiro's Used Cars
A used car dealership supplied by the Steel Vaqueros (and other nomads) and protected by edgerunners who trade service for vehicles.

### (H4) Mrs. Suzuki's Bodega
The most secure and stable market in Old Japantown. Known for being the only distribution point for mushrooms grown by the Shroomers.

### (H5) The Precipice
A cargo container community. Many of the residents earn extra cash by volunteering for experiments at Crisis Medical.

### (H6) Unnamed Cube Hotel
The rooms are cleaned out by ceiling-mounted water jets, and the locks on the doors are dodgy, but at least there are no cameras and no questions.

## Notes

The Precipice (where Magpie lives) is in Old Japantown. It's a dangerous combat zone but has some "islands of civilization" like the Crisis Medical Center and Highcourt Plaza Hotel.
