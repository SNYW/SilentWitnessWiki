# The Dugout

**Type:** Bar / Lounge  
**Area:** Little China (Central The Island)  
**Threat Rating:** Medium

## Overview

The Dugout is a weathered bar and lounge located in the heart of Little China, one of Night City's oldest neighborhoods. Surviving the devastation of the Fourth Corporate War and the radioactive contamination that followed, the establishment has become a favorite among edgerunners, fixers, and those who appreciate a classic Night City watering hole.

## History

### Origins

The Dugout originally opened in the late 2020s as a sports bar catering to fans of the old Night City baseball teams. When professional sports collapsed following the Fourth Corporate War, the bar pivoted to serve a different clientele—mercenaries, fixers, and anyone interested in conducting business away from the corporate spotlight.

### The RED Era

In the 2040s, The Dugout has established itself as a neutral meeting ground. The bar's owner, a former nomad named "Doc" Holliday (no relation to the historical figure), maintains strict neutrality. Anyone who starts trouble is escorted out—permanently.

## Atmosphere

The interior maintains a deliberately retro aesthetic:
- Vintage sports memorabilia lines the walls
- Old holographic baseball games play on cracked screens
- A worn but functional pool table in the back
- Private booths for meetings (available for a premium)

## Notable Features

- **Neutral Ground:** The Dugout operates as neutral territory—corporate agents, gang members, and nomads can drink together without fear of immediate conflict
- **Info Exchange:** Doc Holliday has contacts throughout Night City and often knows where jobs can be found
- **Private Rooms:** Three back rooms available for confidential meetings (预订 required)
- **Cash Only:** No credit, no eddies transfer—just old-fashioned currency

## Clientele

The Dugout attracts a diverse crowd:
- Edgerunners looking for work
- Fixers scouting talent
- Former corpo agents who've gone freelance
- Nomads passing through the city
- Anyone seeking information (for the right price)

## Notes

- The Dugout does not tolerate violence on premises—violators are banned permanently
- Doc Holliday is known for his discretion—client confidentiality is taken seriously
- The bar's jukebox plays pre-war music from various genres
- Doc has standing arrangements with several fixers and can often point edgerunners toward paying work

## Getting There

The Dugout is located on the ground floor of a weathered apartment complex in Little China. The entrance is marked by a faded neon sign showing a baseball player swinging a bat. Look for the handwritten "OPEN" sign in the window.
